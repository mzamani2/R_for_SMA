1,demonreader,"I have a 1 year old Rottweiler (88 pounds) and a 7 year old cat (10 pounds).  We had had smaller drinking fountains for the cat because she really likes running water.  We graduated to a larger one when we got the puppy a year ago, because we didn't want to take away the running water, and the small one just would not do.  As the dog grew, we moved to this one, because, well, she is a big dog.  This dish allows them both to share.  The dog is a messy drinker, so we have the mat that goes underneath, and have the whole thing on a rubber backed water soak up rug.  She also puts all sorts of stuff in the water, from toys to crumbs.  The filter and the running stream allow the pickier cat to use the same container.  Refilling is easy.  Cleaning isn't that hard ( I do it, or, better, have it done once a week).  The noise doesn't disturb us, or the animals.  If I notice it, then I know that it is time to add water.  We have it between the kitchen and the breakfast room, where we pass it constantly, so maybe we are just used to it.  We have had this for almost 5 months now and both of our girls like it just fine. I would have to say that if/when it goes out, we'll get another one.",my animals like it,5
2,emerald,"This is honestly the best toy i've ever found for my little pug. He absolutely loves his snugga wubba. It is definitely mandantory in my house when he goes to bed at night. he will play with it then settle down and snuggle on it and go to sleep.this one was ordered to replace another one. my lab got to the last one and it took him about 2 mins to demolish it. its not durable for bigger dogs who are very hard on toys. but my pug has not been able to inflict any damage to it and he had the last one since last year about a month before Christmas. i ordered it on a lightening deal. so almost a year and it was still in perfect condition after him biting it and scratching at it.i had purchased the kong animal ones as well. soft and the nylon ones. same story, my little babies do great with them but once my lab found them in the house,less than 2 mins to demolish them.overall a great toy for dogs that are medium to low chewers, but unfortunately not durable for bigger dogs that are very hard on toys.",Best toy for my pug i've ever purchased!,5

I found her drinking water one day out of a small pitcher I had placed on the floor while I opened an door to go out and water plants.  It was obvious it was easier for her standing up and not trying to lean over to drink.  Hence finding these feeders and the extension legs to go with.

I have very small hands and I can use them with no problem and they don't slip. The one thing I don't like is the guard, because it gets in my way because I don't use it. But I suppose if you were worried about how you clip the nails, it could come in handy. I try to use it often and just take off the very tips of the nails. Good price too.","Love these nail clippers!

7,Mary Ann,"As the current owner of two pad-trained older dogs, I know a great deal about 'puppy' pads, and usually buy bags of 100 in the conventional size for about $.25 a piece. These larger pads work extremely well, especially in spots where I sometimes put down two conventional pads overlapping (a situation asking for trouble, but necessary).  The price is also competitive, considering that one pad is doing the work of two.  Not only is the pad part larger, but the edge is wider, too, which is helpful. The dogs did not hesitate to use the new 'different' pad, which was a question, prior to introduction.",Truly extra large,5

11,Wings42,"My experience with this collar is very different from Payton Tremaine's.Pros:- It is extremely well made of heavy nylon mesh, strong plastic snap, heavy duty light assembly, and heavy metal loop.- It looks elegant, beautiful enough for daily use.- The switch is easy to use: a press for steady on, another press for blinking, one more for off. Little pressure is required on mine to operate the switch.- My dog is a Labrador mix who loves the water. He swam twice with the collar on with no apparent leakage or damage.- The orange glow is very visible, but not super attention getting, even in blink mode. It's strange seeing what looks like a disembodied orange line as my dog romps around in the distance off leash at night.- The price is reasonable for the quality of this collar.Cons:- None so farHighly recommended.Updated November 12, 2009.

13,Happygoddess,"This is a great concept for a dog toy. My little guy holds it down easily and chews away. A design for the future!  Draw backs--- we've had several and they are all chewed and gone in 1 day, sometimes in an hour or two AND they are expensive for a chew that is gone that fast. That being said, I WILL buy them again. Who would expect that a dog would LOVE pumpkin!  In the past, I've bought him the largest one, but this time, I bought him the Average Joe because my dog is a 20 pound Boston Terrier puppy. Average Joe was quickly gone. Good advice would be to buy bigger than you think you'll need. It will last longer. The design would be great for other companies that make dog chews to adopt. Our only complaint is that he chews it very fast and it's gone fast--- something all reviewers comment about. It changes the color of his stool, too, so don't be surprised. Not a complaint, just an observation.  We will buy more, but not often. I have to remember to buy the larger one next time!

16,"""Vickie R. \""GlamFan\""""","I've been feeding my 4 month old kitten Blue Buffalo Wilderness, which he likes a lot. But, it's very expensive so I've been looking for another dry food to supplement the BB...a little cheaper version that I could alternate or mix in. This stuff looked as if it would fit the bill because it's grain free and looks to have good ingredients, But for some reason my cat will not eat it. I tried mixing it with the BB and he actually noses thru the bowl and shoves the Felidae/Canidae aside. I would say that he's spoiled by the BB but I also feed several feral cats in our yard and they will eat anything and even they turned their nose up at this food. I don't know what's in it but none of my cats will touch the stuff!The other issue I had with this product is I didn't recieve the bag of food that is displayed here...the yellow and white bag. Instead I received a bag with what looked like the same ingredients but it's green and white and has the name Canidae written on it. Now I've heard that this company use to call their dog food Canidae (Canine) and their cat food Felidae (Feline) so I'm not sure if they've decided to drop the Felidae name and just called everything they make Canidae or if there is some sort of glitch happening right now. I also noticed that since I ordered this food just a few days ago, Amazon has labled it with a warning stating &#34;This product is under review&#34; because this has apparently become an issue with numerous people complaining about the same thing. Luckily Amazon is such an outstanding company to deal with...I called them to discuss these issues and they gave me a full refund and told me to do what I wanted with the food, not to even worry about returning it since it was open.

18,T.M. Reader,"""Scanning over the existing reviews on these Waggin' Train Jerky Duos Dog Treats, I see a wide range of opinion, many of them quite negative from the dog health perspective.  I've had some negative experience also. If you'll allow me to share briefly . . . .A few years ago there was nothing short of a national scandal regarding jerky dog treats.  I (as a buyer for my dog) was a victim.  Jerky treats (I probably should not name the brand) that I purchased from a MAJOR discount retail department store (I better not name the store) darn near killed one of my dogs (my Chihuahua mix, Bruiser).  Dogs died all across the US from eating the contaminated treats.  Bruiser is still alive and happy, but is now full diabetic (I give 2 insulin injections daily) and is blind.  His problems began with that container of jerky treats.  The common denominator is that the problem treats were coming out of China.  The newspapers said so, my vet said so, and my experience said so.  When boarding our dogs, to this day my vet will still not allow ANY China manufactured dog food/treats to be left in his facility.  OK, so how about these Waggin' Train Jerky Duos??These Waggin' Train label is a Purina brand.  Generally trusted and highly experienced.  The package boldly states, \""MADE IN THE USA\"".  The package also claims, \""No artificial flavors or preservatives\"".  The package labeling cautions that this is a \""treat\"", and not to be used as part of a balanced diet.  There are dog size guidelines provided, for instance advising that dogs 5-10 pounds should only get half a treat.  The ingredients list sets off no alarms . . . generally all things that one recognizes as \""food\"" (starting with chicken, sweet potatoes, brown sugar) plus a natural preservative element listed as the last ingredient.  I'm satisfied that Purina is manufacturing and marketing these treats responsibly, and as a corporation appears to be well-aware of the past jerky treat controversy.  Personally, I'm satisfied that they know what they are doing and can be trusted -- if for no other reason than preservation of their corporate reputation and public good will.  Purina still markets a China manufactured treat.  I won't use that one.  But these Jerky Duos are made in USA. So far, I'm OK with them.  Now that all those minus and pluses are out of the way, how did my dogs (Bruiser and my terrier, Gizmo) like these treats???These treats are like little cased sausages, a couple of inches longer than my index finger.  My picky dogs took these and investigated cautiously, as they do with any new food.  After a biting in, it was all food love.  They love these and would gladly take seconds . . . but I'll only allow one a day.Considering the apparent reform in the industry regarding these chicken jerky treats, and the apparent quality ingredients and reputable manufacturer - I'll give these yummy treats 5 stars.""",Chicken jerky treats -- safe again?,5

20,Gracie &amp; Scott Whitmore,"""I love this litterbox. I had the first one for a year. The motor died. Just out of warranty, and customer service still replaced it when I emailed them. I now have a second box as well. I love that I just have to top it off every week when I empty the bin, and no more scooping! My cat loves it too. She sits and watches it work, and was quite upset during the time we were waiting for the motor replacement, that it didn't get clean right away! I would recommend this over any of the other automatic litterboxes that I've tried, even if the motor seems to wear out after a year, it's still a great investment in time and energy saving, and no litterbox smell in the house. :)More notes that I thought of:One of the biggest things I like about it, (other than the obvious not having to scoop it) is that the bin sits at the back of the box when not scooping, and the bin is nice sturdy plastic that you put a liner in, making it easy to lift out to clean.  (The littermaid one that I tried has a bin at the front, which the cat steps over to get into the box, and the disposable bin tends to bend and crack when lifting it out.)I have found that the \""World's Best Cat Litter\"" brand seems to work very well with this. Low dust, clumps well, low odor.My cat sometimes pees right against the rake area, so that I have to lift the rake a bit and scrape the litter forward in front of the rake, but that's pretty rare. She did it more when we first got the box, but over a few months, she started peeing right in the middle of the box and doesn't bother covering it anymore, but instead sits and waits for the box to scoop, while she watches in fascination.One thing that will help prevent jams, is to make sure that it's placed so that as the mechanism moves forward, the lid does not hit against anything on either side as it opens. Otherwise, it can get knocked loose and jam in the litterbox. And of course, if the bin is full, the clumps will roll right back out, and onto the floor. Which of course is user error, not the fault of the litterbox. ;)""",Love it!,5

24,"""Nashville Farrell \""GrayBeard the Pirate\""""","""This is a very nice pellet food for both saltwater and freshwater fish. I will write a quick anecdote as a testament to the quality of this food.I received four festivums in the mail from a seller I thought was reputable. When they arrived, all four fish were sick and infested with both parasites and bacterial infections. Two fish were dead upon arrival, one fish died in quarantine in a matter of a day while one fish just lingered close to death. I don't use medications for my fish as I never really encounter illnesses because I usually buy from a different and certainly better fish seller.I didn't think the surviving festivum would live past another day, the festivum didn't seem interested in doing anything other than lingering in the corner of my sick tank. But I went through the motions of keeping his water high quality and feeding him New Life Thera A. Almost the second the food hit the water, the festivum swam over and gently ate the few floating pellets. That a dying fish found this food attractive, is a testament to the quality of this food.Well, with nothing more than clean water and New Life Spectrum Thera A food, my festivum (Festy the festering festivum as I call him) came back to life with a vengeance. In a matter of weeks he was fully healthy with minimal long term damage. He is now king of my cichlid tank.This food is very good. Fish really like it, it has a nice balance of nutrients and ingredients and it doesn't cloud the water. There are downsides, the pellets are small and the food can affect your tank's phosphates if the feeding regimen is too heavy or not monitored. For some types of saltwater tanks this could be a problem, but it can be handled. For me and my fish 'Festy\"", New Life Spectrum Thera A is a sure five star product.""",Remarkable Freshwater Fish Food,5

I tried Feliway previously with an aggressive Tom cat but didn't see any improvement.  I decided to try again to see if Feliway would mellow Pinkie enough that he would eat again.

49,Skydog,"First off let me start by saying I was skeptical of the claims but was willing to go into this with an open mind - especially since the price was so reasonable.  After 6 months of almost daily usage I can honestly say that my cats teeth - mostly toward the back - went from a dull tan/brown color to almost pearly white (my cat is 3 years old).  I am happily amazed.  Why they dont advertise this stuff for humans is beyond me.  Its only a special seaweed.  Maybe dentists would lose business - I cant figure it out.You need to be patient waiting for results - you wont notice any difference in only a month.  After 3 months you will see subtle improvement.  Without before and after photos I still wasnt sure the improvement I saw was real.  Keep at it.  After 5-6 months you will be amazed.As others have stated the bottle goes a long way since you use so little at a time.  1 bottle has lasted me 6 months and I have 3 cats.  If you use dry food do not worry - just sprinkle it on.  Your cat will most likely lick the bowl clean anyway.What I do - and strongly recommend - is to use this along with the CET Dental Chews.  Get the regular kind that looks like little cylinders - not the Advanced Hexadent type.  The reason is PlaqueOff causes plaque and tartar to liquify but you really need some scrubbing action to get this gunk off the teeth.  The dental chews provide that.Oh yeah - if you have a cat - there is another PlaqueOff made especially for cats.  It is flavored to something they will like.  While you can use this version for cats or dogs, cats dont particularly enjoy eating this - though they still seem to down it.So there you go... 2 thumbs up for a great product.",This stuff works!,5

56,Elizabeth,"""UPDATE AUGUST 9 2012: Three years later, and I still use this scoop as my only litter scoop! The handle on mine has not broken or weakened. I have a multi-cat househould and three litter boxes which need scooping daily. Also, I have discovered you CAN use this scoop one-handed. Just use the end of the scoop to open the very top of the container and presto! It opens to allow one to put the scoop back in one-handed! Easy! If you are having trouble with this scoop not handling clumping litter, I suggest changing litter to a stronger clumping litter as some clumping litters do not hold together. I suggest Scoop Away litter (use at least 4 inches and scoop daily) and have found it to form very strong clumps.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I love this scoop!  I use a firm clumping litter designed for multi-cat households, and I need a tough scoop that can match.  The photo does not do this nifty little product justice.The scoop is surprisingly deep.  I have attached a photo showing the depth. The \""working\"" part of the scoop measures 5 x 4 3/4\"" x 2 1/2\"" at its deepest point.  The handle is 6\"" long, bringing total scoop length to about 11\"". The Booda container that houses the scoop is 12\"" high including scoop handle x 6 5/16\"" wide x 5 5/8\"" deep at the widest part of the base.This scoop fit easily inside my cats' three litter boxes (interior size 14\"" x 18\"") and made short work of the litter because it can scoop a large clump all at once.Pros:* Pleasing color* MatchesBooda Dome Cleanstep Cat Litter Box* Deep scoop* Sturdy handle* Can handle large clumps* Easily maneuvers inside smaller litter boxesCons:* There is glue from the label that peeled off which I need to remove.  That is the one bone I'd like to pick with Booda - the sticker leaves behind a sticky residue.* Cannot operate scoop/holder one-handed. (NOTE: See my update August 2012: You CAN operate this one-handed: see my trick!) When I remove the scoop from its holder to use it, the holder will not stay open.  After I use the scoop, it is hard to get the scoop back into the holder using only one hand, because the holder wants to stay in the closed position. Ideally for convenience it would be nice to be able to operate this scoop/holder with only one hand.Far superior to the cheap scoop I previously use, I am very pleased with this one.  The handle seems plenty strong to me.  Recommended!""",Three-Year Review: The perfect scoop!,5

However, he can definitely run at full speed and the thin cord holding this to the base has yet to snap or fail in anyway. I'll probably keep using this until it fails. To be honest though, you can really train your dog not to constantly tug on the leash and try to get out of your range/lead. The leash may simply be there as a reminder you are in control, or for an extreme situation (dog gets to excited and quickly jolts after something before you have a chance to respond and him to acknowledge). Of course that training may not work with all dogs, but of the three dogs I've owned and trained, I didn't really have the problem of the \""dog walking the owner\"" as I see commonly done up and down the streets.Overall a good leash, can hold at least the weight its rated at and then some, at a good price.""",Holds back our 50lb golden,5

81,"""Desert Gypsy \""A Brooklyn Girl Out West\""""","""I have both tested/tried and bought/owned several types of training or no-bark collars and this is the first one to get everything right! Has every feature I could possibly want to deter my dog's recently developed habit of excessive nuisance barking. The various settings allow you to customize the corrections to the setting that is just right. I did not want to use a progressive correction for two reasons: one, I did not want my dog to get in a habit of \""testing\"" a collar to see how much he can get away with (been there, done that), and two I did NOT want to find out what might happen if it automatically progressed to level 9 if he was barking in an emergency for real DANGER. For me, this collar works as a training aid to give me the control I need to get the result I want.The various programs give me the ability to find the very *smallest* correction that would be necessary to get my dog's attention. It was easy to follow the directions to manually set the stimulation. After my dog received the first correction, there was an immediate attitude adjustment for the better - no more nuisance barking! To clarify, he still can and does bark with the collar on - one or two small woofs! in low tones to let me know someone is at the door and it does not set off a correction, but no more incessant, repeated, or LOUD barking.Also of note, the collar fits very well on my small breed dog (15lbs). The collar has a shiny patent leather look and is very adjustable but the collar can easily be swapped for a simple nylon one which can offer an even better fit. The \""box\"" does not appear excessively large for his small dog frame. The button to change the setting is VERY hard for me to hold down to adjust the settings but once it is set the unit remembers what I had programmed when I turn it back on so this is not a huge problem - this *could* be by design so there's NO chance the dog can somehow bump the button and change the setting accidently.

I find some of the cats like them one day then not the next. The trick may be to feed just before meal time when they are hungriest. I wish the manufacturer could figure out which ingredients cause the fussiness and find alternatives.I don't like that these contain rosemary extract, but most people are feeding processed, junk food pet diets and rosemary would be amongst the least of their concerns. If you're concerned, you could feed the Renal Essentials tablets(  Vetri-Science Laboratories Renal Essentials for Cats - 60 Count) to avoid the rosemary. Most of our cats don't like the tablets but they are easy enough to crush with a mortar and pestel and, when added to food, don't create an extreme repulsion.With renal disease, the most important thing is that the cat eat and that it eat easy to digest quality protein. If adding a supplement affects appetite, it isn't worth trying to add it to food. If your pet refuses all Renal Essentials, try the Rx Vitamins Rx Renal Feline (your vet might carry this). This comes in a small enough capsule to be shoved down the cats throat or possibly hidden in a pill pocket. I also like the organic pet superfood immunity (Organic Pet Superfood IMMUNITY Premium Supplement For Dogs and Cats) formula for quelling the autoimmunity that contributes to most feline renal failure.I like the idea of giving these products for pets with various autoimmune conditions, not just renal disease.

113,Deanna Shauntel,"Pros:1. My ferrets quickly got used to climbing up and down the ramps.2. The cage is fairly large. It is big enough for my ferrets to wrestle and play around in.3. The tray is very convenient for when my ferrets decide they do not want to use the litter box.4. There is a website to order replacement parts for Prevue Hendryx, so hopefully I can have most of my cons solved with a replacement ramp :)Cons:1. When I first opened the package and took everything out, I realized that some of the pieces has a little bit of rust on them (this made me wary, but it wasn't bad enough for me to try returning the cage). Also one of outside hooks on one of the platforms was broken.2. Some of the screws were hard to put in during assembly and I'm not new to building things.3. Back to the broken platform: it was not a problem at first, but my ferrets like to play around in the cage, so they tend to knock the platform down and it makes them unable to climb to the second level. Also, when I took the ramp off of the broken platform, one of the pieces that holds the ramp up popped up.4. The part where the tray is supposed to go in was bent when I opened the box which makes it hard to pull the tray in and out for cleaning.Overall, I do feel like I received a fairly good deal for the price I paid. I do believe that some of the issues that I had may have occurred during shipping (at least that is what I hope). My only main problem now with the cage is the broken ramp I mentioned.I do recommend if you would like to have a lot of living space while your ferrets are caged.Update June 26: The ramps do break way to easily and the bars of the cage bend easily, but that also means that they bend back into place easily. The company that sent me a replacement ramp sent it out for free and it arrived quickly. But, the other ramp has already broken which is really annoying. This is the reason I can't upgrade to a 4-star rating.",Slight problems,3

117,Nalin Nirula,"Reading a number of negative and positive reviews about the Furminator and the other de-matting rakes, I came to the conclusion that used on its own, either product may not do the job properly. So, in addition to the Furminator for Long Hair, Medium dog, I ordered a Safari de-matting comb/rakeSafari De-Matting Comb for Dogs, and theJW Pet Company GripSoft Dematting Rake Dog Brush. This Furminator has a blade width of about 2.5 inches (6.5 cms).My 16 month old English Cocker Spaniel (Soul) has long hair and had deeply entangled knots everywhere despite daily brushing, combing and slicker brush usage. With some trial and error, I worked out the following protocol that gives excellent results for removing knots and mats.3 methods and tools needed to be used to untangle the mats and knots:(1) I started with the Safari de-matting comb/rake to cut through the worst tangles and knots. I used this instead of the JW Dematting brush as the blades of the JW appear to be sharper and more formidable compared to the Safari, and I did not want to use this for a first time experience.*The technique for all such procedures was to grip the matted hair and pull the rake through the mats in a way so that the dog's skin would not get pulled. In other words, starting from the outer edges of the mats, gripping the mat part way, not allowing the skin to be pulled while using the rake. As the knots get cut, move further down until the mats are gripped as close to the skin as possible, applying opposite pressure while pulling the rake through with the other hand.(2) The Safari comb has 5mm gaps between the 9 blades of about 0.5 mm thickness (the JW  has 6 mm gaps, 10 blades of 1 mm thickness each). At the end of it, we were left with small rope-like knotted strands of matted hair that the comb could not engage with. So, enter the 2nd, most useful tool/technique:-- holding the matted hair at the base with thumb and fingers of both hands, and gently separating the mats like fluffing cotton. (It felt like fluffing compacted cotton from the silk-cotton tree!). This did not usually cause Soul any pain. Where the long mats were not amenable to this process, or there was pain, we simply clipped the mats off with a scissor.  The short matted knots were then combed out with the de-matting comb and/or the FURminator.(3)Finally, the Furminator came into play when most of this heavy work was done, and it did a great job of removing excessive hair from Soul's coat. A gentle use of a bristle brush gave the finishing touches.Note: The blades of the Safari comb went out of alignment after the use on heavy matting. The JW has an advantage that the blades are fixed--bonded into the plastic head, and will have to snap off rather than pull out of alignment.* I used the JW for removing the short strand mats and it worked well. The JW GripSoft Dematting Rake Dog Brush is a very formidable device and I would probably use this in preference to the Safari once I am more comfortable with handling the rake. Both the Safari and the JW have sharp blades so one would need to handle them with care.A note about the Furminator, and Safari comb--there appear to be different models of some of these products and it is advisable to check out the specific one referred to in the reviews. There is a confusion and profusion of suppliers of the Furminator--many supplying the same model but at very different prices--I chose a product listing by 'Furminator', where the order was sold by a supplier other than Furminator, but fulfilled by Amazon.Bottom line is: The FURminator is a great tool to use in conjunction with other tools for removing excess hair and grooming your animal. The de-matting combs/rakes are essential for removal of knotted hair and mats. I have ordered a rotating pin comb for Soul (Master Grooming Tools Steel Teeth Pet Rotating Pin Comb, Medium and Coarse, 7-1/2-Inch) and this may well complete the coat grooming tools needed.","One of 3 best tools/techniques to remove pet hair knots,mats and tangles",4

154,"""T. Morris \""On The High Desert\""""","I'm not sure why some cat food gets a bad review because a cat doesn't eat it. We have 7 here in our rural home, plus some strays that stop by for a meal, and though they can be finicky they all eat pretty much what we put in front of them when they're hungry. They get fed 3 times a day and canned food is the morning meal so perhaps having nothing out from about 6 PM to 6 AM makes this pretty inviting. We have one cat that's about 17 years old and all she can eat is canned food. I can't say how good it is but at less than 45 cents a can (including shipping) it's less than at the local food store that happens to be about 45 miles away... as is the Vet. We feed them dry food (the grain free expensive kind) for the other 2 meals a day so the canned food is also a bargain.We had a cat develop some urinary problems: bladder stones which restricted her ability to urinate and caused some bleeding and she was trying to urinate all day long to help relieve the irritation. The Vet claimed it was from the poor ingredients in some dry cat food that causes the stones because the cat can't process enough liquid to handle the food. He wanted to put her on a special diet with a Science Diet dry special blend for Urinary Tract and then onto one of their regular formula kibble for life. That seemed a little useless because we were feeding the cats some decent kibble to begin with like Purina One. We did a search and found that it was true that a lot of filler in most dry cat food was grain and that is hard for cats to process. The diet we found involved a home made cat food of grinding up some rabbit and chicken and adding some vitamins. Tried it and it worked but it was a mess to make, rabbit is not cheap or easy to find and it takes up a lot of freezer space. Back to another search and a viable alternative seemed to be canned cat food, with some limitations, and a grain free kibble. The canned food doesn't have as much fillers and the main ones for us are poultry, fish & meat varieties in pt&eacute; or gravy form. That's what the cats are on now and the kidney/urinary problem is gone, their coats are nicer, their urine is more, but urinates fewer times, now because they don't have to consume so much water to process the grain feed and they really seem to like what they're eating. We feed them Friskies & 9-lives in the cans and Blue Buffalo Wilderness, Merrick Before Grain, Felidae or Taste of the Wild in dry food. The dry food is getting pricier, the bags are getting smaller and the free shipping deals are disappearing so it's more of a challenge now to get a deal but when we do we buy extra. Can't say enough about how well this new diet seems to be working and any saved trip to a Vet pays for a lot of food. In general, the cats prefer a dry food that's fish flavored.What we're doing is based on the information provided by Lisa A. Pierson, DVM on Making Cat Food (catinfo.org) and she is of the opinion that cats need the bones which makes the grinding process more difficult. We still feed them some kibble because feeding 7 cats, plus some strays, gets pretty expensive. It's a shame packaging is getting smaller and prices do nothing but remain the same or go up. We purchase the Merrick and Wild Buffalo grain free dry foods and the bags are now down to 11 lbs. each. However, when doing the math the canned food is still less expensive per serving.As long as Amazon keeps giving deals on this we'll keep buying it, the cats will keep eating it and that's worth 5 stars... in my opinion. We had Subscribe & Save on some other brands but they disappear soon since it's heavy to ship and it's recently disappeared on some of the bagged food or the price has gone up significantly. I'm posting this same review to every cat food we purchased rather than editing each to fit the particular brand. As an example, I was paying about 8 bucks for Friskies canned food in the 5.5 ounce 24-pack and it's now a little over 16 bucks so if you see some deals on this savings program buy a lot of it or keep an item in your cart to see if the price drops and then subscribe... you'll be guaranteed that price for the first month delivery. If it continues... and the price continues to rise we'll stop buying them and even with 15% off and free shipping they cost more than at the food store... about 10 bucks for a 24-pack is pretty much what we pay at the food store though we will pay a bit more just to have it come in a case... end of price increase rant!Update 1/17/14: As expected, Amazon just raised the price... though it's only 50 cents it will likely go up more. So I checked the list of other sellers and found PetFoodDirect had it for on sale (27.79) and after checking their Website I found they also had free shipping so I purchased 2 more bags. If how much you pay is important then check prices before buying... even though I didn't.",7 cats are rating 7 paws up!,5

160,Zoya,"This is the best litter I have tried.  Originally I thought to myself &#34;All cat litter must be the same&#34; before I tried this brand.  Now I know better.It has the least dust of anything I have ever used for my cats - you can dump the bag out and see almost no visible dust anywhere.  Of course it has some dust owing to the nature of the product but it is negligible.  I used to hold my breath when adding more litter to try to avoid breathing in vast clouds of particulates.It will not make a filthy box smell clean but it does trap odors better and hold odors less than other litters I have tried.  I really like the scented version of this that comes in a purple bag.If you think there is no difference between cat litters, think again.  You have to try this at least once to see the difference.

If you want to visit outdoors with the neighbor, forget it, because they bark the ENTIRE time.  I ordered one Dogtra YS300 to use for both dogs.The pros:1.  It says for small to medium dogs, but is very effective with my lab mix also.2.  It has a vibration warning before the correction.3.  It can be set to vibrate only when the correction is learned.4.  The battery is rechargeable in about 2 hours.The cons:1.  Even on the LOWEST setting, it is a little too strong for my mini schnauzer.  She squealed on the correction of \""2\""  which I did not like.  (However, I can set it to vibrate only for her which works well.)2.  The strap is very long, but it can be cut to fit, so not a big \""con\""3.  My dogs do already know that they can bark when the collar is off, however the duration is shorter.I will have to update my review in the future in order to address durability.To make a long story short, I like this collar, and will be ordering another one so that both dogs will have one to wear when we go camping, etc.Edit to add:  It has been two years and the collar still works great.

167,untilmake,"Eheim Classic 2211 has two different hose sizes for intake and outflow. If you simply use its intake tube and outflow tube (jet stream sprayer), this is not a problem at all. However, Eheim's trademark green tube can stand out too much that some like me want to replace it with clear tubes or glass tubes. Then, the two different sizes of hoses may give you some difficulties.I bought a set of glass tubes for intake and outflow. They are for 9 mm (3/8 in) hoses. Now, then, the intake hose of 2211 is 12mm (1/2 in). Eheim has a reducer for 12mm to 9mm. But, do you want to spend around $13-15 (including shipping) just for a plastic reducer? The whole filter set is under $80!If you need a reducer for intake tube, try this way. I cut a part of 9mm tube and apply aquarium safe glue (which should be a sealant, too, like Marine Coop) and inserted to the 12mm tube. This works because the outer diameter of 9mm tube is 12mm. You can finish put some more of glue outside the joint to seal it. This works without leaking because the direction of water flow is from 9mm to 12mm, which means not so much water pressure is on the joint.The filter operate very quietly. I cannot notice noise from 3 feet away. For the noise wise, it is so much better than hang-over power filters.Some might wonder or worry about priming the filter. It's not hard at all. Well, you shall suck the hose. But, you don't have to taste the water. This filter uses gravity. It has to be put below the level of your aquarium.1) First, don't plug in the filter yet.2) All you have to do for priming is that to put your canister down and to suck the outflow hose so that the water fills the inside the filter and some lower part of the outflow hose. You can do it while you watch the outflow tube.3) Then, set your tubes.4) And plug in to start the impeller.5) Now, you will hear the filter is working. You will hear bubble and water noise inside the filter. You will see bubbles coming out from the outflow tube.6) You may leave it there, but, I would shake the filter until all the air is out. Even if there is no noise, there can still be air inside the filter. When there is no bubble coming out, I can say the priming is done.This priming can be done in 5 min. The newer Eheim Ecco filters self prime, but I guess for 2211 it is worth because you don't need a huge lung capacity to prime it.",Two different hose sizes for a one filter / priming is easy,4

174,"Linda in Jax, Florida","After one bag of the Blue Buffalo regular Wilderness food the results were amazing.  I have a female who is overweight so I bought a bag of  the indoor version to see if she would take to this as well as she had to the regular formula. Two months and 3 cats later I can report the following:I yr old male=Loves it. Kibbles not too large for him.  No prior health problems, but a picky eater!  Coat is so shiny, eyes bright.2 yr old male=very sensitive stomach-only vomited once after changing to these Blue Buffalo products whereas it used to be a daily occurrence..I was forever cleaning up vomit. He had a problem keeping anything down and I am so glad I finally found something that works for him.  He ate my Pottery Barn plastic grass thinking it was the cat grass I usually buy at the pet store and he ended up having it perforate his tummy and intestines.  Needless to say, food has been a big problem since his emergency surgery until now.  Shiny coat, bright eyes.7 yr old female=my girl was very overweight, fur felt like a Brillo pad, dandruff thick as snow, and she had constant UTI and anal gland problems and was very fatigued and grumpy.  Now she is bright eyed, her coat is soft and the tons of dandruff has all but disappeared.  She also seems to be more comfortable 'down there' and she is able to eliminate properly.  She has never eaten wet food and believe me, I tried every brand and flavor I could find. I used fish oil, various cranberry concoctions, Laxatone...you name it and nothing helped.  I am so very happy with these dry foods ( I mix them in equal parts) that I can't imagine ever feeding my babies anything else.  It took a long time, much trial & error, but BB has taken care of all their health issues after just two short months....now, if they could just add something to stop the increased late night romping, chasing and playing, I might get a good night's sleep!!  Yes, even the 7 year old is playing again.  It is pricey, but beats the heck out of the Vet bills but most importantly, all three cats have shown so much improvement; skin, coats, eyes, no vomiting, no hairballs, proper elimination, and although they eat it, no pigging out as was usual with other foods, even the other name brands.  I am thrilled!",Great product,5
175,Lisa,"Amazing.  I thought I was doing well feeding by 3 yr old boxer the salmon/sweet potato (grain free) mix from costco.  I know boxers have sensitive stomaches, and my girl is no exception. When I walk her 30-60 minutes, she would often go through 8 poop bags and have liquid diarrhea by the end.  I really thought there was nothing I could do - I had tried adding various things to her food to help solidify her poops, but by things I had read online, boxers are just excitable dogs and well, it shows in their bowel movements.I decided to do some more investigation into the food I was feeding her and this one got great reviews.  The ingredients did look a little better, so I decided to give it a try.  I really didn't think I would notice a difference, but WOW!  Now I go through 1-2 poop bags per walk, and no more diarrhea!  I am so happy and my baby girl must feel so much better. This just proves to me how much better this product must really be.

176,Emily,"Hello! Just got this today in the mail.Here's what I have to say about it;1 ) To the reviews about the cracked bottom; they now put a piece of cardboard in to prevent the smaller container that is packaged in the big one from hitting it directly. Seemed to work.2 ) Will it hold 25lbs? Yes, but it will be tight and the scoop won't fit. I put in 15lbs immediately and it filled it over halfway. It can probably tightly pack another 10lbs, but I wouldn't do that much because I like the scoop fitting. A safe fit would be 20lbs if you want the scoop inside.3 ) Air tight? Eh, no. I wouldn't call it air tight, but most clip-lock containers and plastic containers are never truly air tight if it just flips over and locks. The lock will pop up easily, but locks firmly as well.4 ) This will be EASY for dogs to get into and knock over if they are medium or large. My dog, luckily, doesn't get into food (excluding the cat bowl when its full and we're gone), so I don't worry about it. But this isn't 'dog proof'.5 ) I liked the color for the blue moon I got. Though, I got it because I have a 'Blue' Heeler. It works, right?6 ) The small container is a nice size and can probably fit 10 lbs (excluding scoop). I'm going to use mine for short stays at client's houses when I go for short stays. I'll just bring the larger one when I have a long stay.7 ) The rollers worked well on the bigger guy. Fit snugly and didn't fall out.Overall, I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 stars. Why? Because though I like it, I wish they had made it just a bit bigger for the amount of food it says its hold, and the not quite tight latches.","Great, but small.",4

220,H. Goslow,"Cat loves this food and it is very good for him.  I feed part dry food and part wet, i split each can into thirds.  I take a third each day put it in a magic bullet ( blender) add 3/4 cup water (sometimes tuna fish or chicken juice if i have just drained them for my consumption) this adds more liquid to a cats diet.With any research cats normally are dehydrated because their natural foods they eat would provide liquids but we feed processed or dry food which they don't get enough water intake.  Also having a purely wet food diet which will help with the dehydration is bad for their teeth, you would need to brush their teeth multiple times a day to keep their teeth healthy on a purely wet food diet.So this is my solution to a healthy cat, i sneak in more liquid to my cats diet (blended water and wet food) and still have him eat dry food that helps clean his teeth as he crunches through it.  If you are curious i feed wellness core original wet food.if you are trying to save a little money the kirkland(costco) cat food is almost as good for your cat as this is, plus it is cheeper.  I just know this is kinda pricy but good quality products are in here, and the reason i mention the kirkland is that lots of people want a little cheeper food and go to science diet or others that have a ton of advertising behind them but they are poor quality and kirkland is the same to cheeper and a better quality so if you decide slightly too expensive on wellness core, check out kirkland compared to others.Good luck finding the best diet for your cat and you.",Well balanced food,5

I used these on my black cat after he scratched my dogs eye ball twice in 6 months during play both times needing surgery to help a scratch that became an indolent eye ulcer.Our cat is a large 17lb male needing the large caps which fit well, his back claws could use the xl size but we made the large work anyhow.I tried to do this at our house with husband helping but our cat was wild, biting and scared. I took him to my friend's house who is also a groomer, in a crate. He was scared stiff which is what I needed to get the job done. Pets sometimes behave better out of the house in unfamiliar settings. We followed the instructions to a T. I put him back in the crate and we had ourselves some tea which also gave time to let the glue dry to his claws before driving home and letting him out. In addition to following the instructions, make sure your glue batch is fresh. If yours is not, many groomers I know who offer this as a service use super glue or salon nail glue instead of an old glue batch.When we got home, he ran out of the crate and started cleaning his feet/toes but didn't remove any of the caps. We applied the caps 4 weeks ago and he still has them all.  He still goes to all of the scratching posts and digs on them like crazy. He claws our couch over and over but doesn't do damage which is such a relief!  Of course, we did this for our poor lovely dog who is the real victim and hopefully never again.If you're not sure about this, call around for someone to do it for you. Many groomers/vets offer this as a service.","The key is application, these work!",5

241,Jennifer O Cote,"""We got an Australian Kelpie puppy in December of 2011. We were told he was crate trained, and he seemed fine in his crate at first. But as the weeks went on, he became more and more anxious when we would leave the house. We could hear his howling down the street. We recorded him using a laptop webcam, and we discovered that when we were away from the house, he would pace, howl, bark, and cry almost the entire time we were gone.We followed every protocol there is for separation anxiety, and nothing we did worked. If we left the house (no matter how quietly without excitement), and we left lots of entertaining things in his crate for him to invest his time in, they would be untouched when we returned.We tried essential oils like chamomile and lavender, and they also had no effect.A trainer recommended DAP, and we have used Feliway successfully, so we decided to try it.Within four hours of us plugging in the DAP diffuser, we had a different puppy. He stopped all his distressing behaviors and enjoyed everything we provided for him in his crate in our absence. Through recordings, we discovered that he slept most of the time, and if he opted not to play with an interactive toy, it was because he was sleeping.We have since discontinued use of the diffuser, and he still happily uses his crate even when we are absent. When we know something stressful is going to occur (outside construction, fireworks, or change in routine), we'll plug a diffuser back in a day or two prior just to easy any additional stress as a precaution. But four months after starting the diffuser, we no longer need it on a daily basis.It's important to note that this should be used as a supplement to behavior modification and exercise. The mantra of \""A tired puppy is a happy puppy\"" is very true. Our puppy needed some additional exercise in conjunction with the diffuser, though we found the diffuser alone did help most of his isolation distress. But everything else needs to be addressed (behavior before leaving the house, exercise, entertaining the dog while you're not home, etc.) as well.If plugging in the diffuser doesn't work right away, follow the instructions and give it at least one to three months before giving up. It can be a process. Not everyone will have the immediate results we did.Please note: If you have used Feliway for cats, the plug-in is exactly the same, so you can take a DAP refill and attach it to the diffuser.""",Worked almost instantly for a puppy with isolation distress,5

262,Robin Friedman,"""The reviews here on Amazon seem to be for a variety of products, ranging from kittens to adults.  To be clear, I am reviewing the Science Diet dry cat food for adults, aged between 1 and 6 years.I got my cat from the local animal shelter about 7 months ago and she is now about 2 years old. She has become a treasured pet.  The Hills Science Diet company provided food to my local shelter as to many others: a classic example of doing well by doing good. I received a complimentary bag when I adopted my cat.I did some serious research on cat food and learned more about it than perhaps I care to know.  Informed views vary, as with virtually any subject, on the merits of dry versus wet cat food, on the qualities of different brands, and on cost.On dry versus wet -- I feed my cat predominantly wet food consistently with most but not all recommendations. But she gets at least some dry food daily and I feed dry food when I am going to be out of the house for most of the day, as it can be eaten at the cat's own pace. Make sure the cat has plenty of water available.Hills Science Diet is a long time manufacturer of pet food with an established reputation. This dry food for adult indoor cats is a high quality product which has been advertised as suitable for weight control, with proteins and antioxidants. The product is nutritionally complete and balanced in accordance with established and recognized standards (AFASCO).  With some wishful thinking, perhaps, I have designated my cat as \""indoor\"" although she looks yearningly outside.  She had this food at the shelter and after some experiementing I have settled on it as her indoor cat food.  She always eats it readily, both when I feed it as her daily food and when I feed it as a supplement to her wet food, and leaves nothing left over. The food comes in small pellets, sometimes triangular but more recently round in what I think is an improved version.  I am confident in and trust this product and the cat likes it.  It has received high reviews from impartial and capable professional reviewers.  I have relied upon several detailed reviews in addition to my own experience with the product.The product is not the most inexpensive, but it is worth it. It is not as easy to find as supermarket brands but is reasonably accessible.All told, an excellent dry food for an indoor cat. I am happy with it, the cat is happy with it, and I enjoyed learning about it.Robin Friedman""",Excellent Adult Indoor Cat Food,5

280,Brass Monkey,"I was really excited when I first saw this product.  Even though I clean out my dog's water bowl daily, it always seems to be filled with dust, food particles and his hair.  I know it's marketed as a 'Cat' water filter but I figured it would work fine for my dog who isn't much larger then a cat to begin with.  As it turns out, they do have a 'Dog' version of this filter and as far as I can tell, it's the exact same product (same size/specs and filter requirements) with a minor difference in price.First thing to consider before making this purchase...  Do you have a low laying power outlet near your pet's water bowl?  I know I'm pointing out the obvious for anyone who has the ability to 'look at the photo' but double check anyways.  I thought for certain I had low outlets in my kitchen and ended up having to relocate my pup's water bowl into the family room.  That aside, I strongly feel that a battery operated device would have been more appropriate for this type of filtration device from both a portability and safety perspective.  There's just something about plugging an electrical device submerged into your pets water bowl that gets you thinking... is this safe?  Theoretically, I think it 'should' be safe because the outlet remains above the water source but if you have cats that like to play in their water, a playful puppy who sometimes slides into his water bowl, or maybe even just clumsy housemates who often kick the pet's water bowl in the middle of the night (sigh), it seems like an electrical hazard in the making.  Maybe splashing water on an outlet in use isn't something to worry about?  If anyone is savvy on this and can give me a yay or nay on 'dangerous or not' I'd love to hear from you.  Right now, I just unplug it before I go to bed to make sure my housemates don't kick it and start a fire.The filter itself is easy enough to use.  Suction cups hold it to the bottom of your pet's water bowl and once plugged in, water whirs around and is cleaned by the carbon filter.  Here's the other 'semi-obvious' caveat of this water filter.  You'll need to purchase replacement filters and you need to buy them fairly often - perhaps a little too often in my opinion (thank goodness they're not all that expensive but it'll add up over time).  The enclosed instructions say to replace the water filter every 2 to 4 weeks.  I know these are small filters but they're pushing relatively small amounts of water, the same water, around and around in the same bowl all day long.  2 to 4 weeks seems too short.  If it weren't for the fact that I want to filter out debris that manages to fall into his water bowl on a daily basis (puppy's got a mustache), I'd just continue to give him filtered tap water from my Pur Water Faucet that only requires replacement once every 3-4 months in my home (daily puppy water and drinking water for 3 adults).Not 'bad' but I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone.  I'm going to use the remaining filters I bought and then decide if it's worth the expense to continue using.",Not a fan of the 2 to 4 week filter life span.,3

It's not like they'll say, \""This is too bitter for me; I'd prefer a different flavor or perhaps more attractive presentation on the plate.\"" All you get is the evidence: an empty dish, or a paw scraping the floor suggesting where the cat thinks the \""food\"" should go. How well MY cats like something is no suggestion about what yours will think.Still...One of our cats eats nearly everything (even if she's apt to reject it later, attached to a hairball). The other one is set in his ways, and when it comes to cat treats that means soft ones -- and really,Whisker Lickin's Tender Moments Cat Treats, and chicken-and-cheese ONLY, please. (He gets a treat every time the Arizona Diamondbacks win a baseball game, which may be why he pays such close attention to the pitching on TV; he's been mentioned on TV as the team's Rally Cat.) I have tried him on other types of treats, especially the crunchy ones, since they're supposedly better for the cats' teeth. I usually get a cat response of confusion: \""You think this is food? Well, okay, but it's certainly not a TREAT. Now how about some of that Swiss cheese you thought you'd have with YOUR breakfast? Otherwise I'll sit here and look sad because you offered me a treat when there isn't one.\"" (Not that I'm a crazy cat lady or anything.)Still, when Amazon Vine offered me this \""variety pack\"" of crunchy treats (six in the package: Tasty Chicken, Seafood Medley, Tempting Tuna, Blissful Catnip) I figured I'd give it a try. It did say CATNIP after all.Shaka thought the crunchy bit was okay, but acted as though I'd pulled a single kibble out of her bowl of dry food and tried to pass it off as a treat. Meriwether just looked at the catnip treat as if I'd put a rock next to him. When I petted him encouragingly, he -- an amiable kitty -- decided I wanted him to do something with it, so he batted the cat treat as if it were a toy, then looked up at me as if to say, \""So I guess it's a catnip toy? It's a very small one.\"" He didn't eat it, but Shaka found it acceptable.The rest -- I tried all the flavors -- did little better. Tuna was okay to Shaka, but did not elicit the OH BOY A TREAT response.Then again, these two have never cared about the crunchy treats, which felt unfair to Whiskas. So I gave the box to my best friend, who has nine cats. SOMEONE surely would put these away, I assumed. And I assumed correctly: She reports that those who like crunchy treats all liked these flavors; the bags won't last all that long.In short: If your cats like crunchy treats, these'll do.

Already gone through the diet changes, and stuff. I recently noticed that both pets were scratching more frequent, and losing hair. So I went on the hunt. Reading the reviews, I began to think possibly there skin was dry, because they both are indoor pets; with the exception of my dog going out to be excused several times a day. And now it is winter, and the central heat is a dry circulating heat.The first bath participant was my short haired petite cat. It usually takes about 10 or more minutes to bathe her thoroughly anyhow. Which makes the manu- directions of letting the product stay on, at least 10 minutes, worked out fine. I usually bathe at night; to give her skin time to recover the rest of the night; then the effects of the product will be made known immediately, when she wakes up the next day. So the next morning, no crazy scratching, nor pulling her hair. This stuff worked so well, I bathed my dog the next night. Using the same technique; letting the shampoo stay on for 10 minutes. This was the only shampoo that has given both my precious pets relief.I did notice that my dog started scratching again, a few days later. So I decided to reapply the water, and Epi shampoo on a cloth, but only on his hot spots. I did this while he was lying on the bed. I let this solution, soak in approx 30 minutes, while he ran, and played, inside the house. Then rinsed him off in the bathtub. That application really did the job. He is so happy, and jolly not having to stop playing, just to scratch. He used to wake up with a violent itch, and I knew it was not from fleas, nor bacterial infection, because the Zymox would take care of that.

340,"""Rhiana Jones \""Author of A Frugal Life: Learni...""","I was a little skeptical when I got this. I mean, only 4 treats at a time? I have THREE dogs.However, it proved to be really easy and went pretty fast. The recipes are all based off one standard dog cookie recipe with whole wheat flour. You then add your mix-ins like cheese or bananas. I just used the standard recipe and added applesauce and peanut butter. The mix smelled bad and tasted worse. Yes, I tasted it ok? But it was easy to drop it into the cookie molds and pretty easy to do it cleanly. I thought it would make a bigger mess, but it didn't.You then close the lid, lock and wait about 5 minutes. It says to go 10 but I found after the first batch, the machine was too hot to go 10 minutes and 5 was just fine.I thought it was going to take a long time to do a full batch, only 4 cookies at a time. I was already in the kitchen baking bread for the family though so it was no problem to just keep plopping in 4 more over and over until they were done.The cookies came out great, if you see the picture above, some of them brown faster than others depending on if they were an earlier batch or a later batch, the machine seems to get hotter and hotter and there is no temperature control. It was perfectly fine though, the dogs don't care if they are toasty or not toasty.

341,"""Goldengate \""Goldengate\""""","We have a rescue cat named Hudson who tips the scales around 19 pounds.  20 when he's not been doing his work out.  The second I opened this food he came running (which he does not do very often) from the other room to check it out  (Incidentally he is sitting on my lap as I type this, making sure I give this product a good review).  I mixed some in his bowl with his old food to avoid stomach upset (start with 90-10%, then 80-20 then 50-50 etc over a few weeks to minimize vomit surprises in the middle of the night which is when it seems like they always happen) and he waddled right over and ate it right up, pushing some of his old food out of the way.  His vet put him on Hills Prescription Diet r/d which is very expensive and not available via Amazon and I haven't seen a big change in weight...but Ragdoll breed is big boned....?  He has also been on their &#34;Science Diet Adult Dry Light Food&#34; which he likes the least of them all.Here are some of the nutrition facts for each of the three:Prescription Diet R/D (expensive, vet only):  $35 for 8.5 pounds ($4.12 a pound, wow!)Protein: 31%Crude Fat: 7-10%Crude Fiber: 16%Moisture: 10.5%Adult Light:  $27 for 17.5 pounds ($1.54 a pound subscribe and save)Protein 28.5%Fat: 7%Fiber: 5.5%-9.5%Moisture: 10%THIS food (Science Diet Perfect Weight): $31 for 15.5 pounds ($2 a pound subscribe and save)Protein: 36%Fat: NOT listed on product label!Fiber: 10%Moisture: 8%So as you can see, this product has higher fiber and protein than the &#34;light&#34; food but still less than the prescription food.  I am surprised that the fat content is not listed on the label since the same manufacturer has listed it on their other products.  I will update this review with my cat's weight loss progress but frankly even with an auto-feeder that regulates his consumption, I think he's battling genetics as well as making up for when he was a starving stray on the streets.Given that he loves this food, that it provides more protein and fiber (which helps make them feel full) than the light and will help save me some $$$, I think we will switch  to this food.Again, I'll update this review as needed once he consumes more.Hope this helps!",My cat loves this food... compares favorably to prescription-only Hills r/d,5

352,"""M. Prieto \""Havanese friend\""""","This filter is designed for a much bigger aquarium but it works beautifully. I ended up looking at the box and on the web to assemble it correctly. The directions are awful. The water is crystal clear in my tank which is great and it's super silent. I'm using the ceramic link tube things as my bottom filtration. The only issue, you have to set this up just right! Once you lock the tubes in with the screw thingies...you may never undo them! I ended up making my tube lengths a little too long and managed to shorten it a bit by cutting the tubing that connects to my tank shorter. Don't make my mistake!The design is wonderful. Great product!Oh, the first time you clean it, make sure you drain (open all the levers) into a bucket. Afterwards, slowly dump onto a towel each section (the sponge at the bottom will keep it all from descending into a nightmarish pile which is great (it's thick and big). I found two kuhli loaches and two babies at the bottom of my bucket! They can easily get sucked into the filter. I would recommend doing your maintenance once a month and making sure you cut the tubing so that the strainer is higher up on the glass wall if you're planning on kuhli loaches. Oh, this is a typical problem for ALL filters (didn't want you guys to this this was a design error - not - a kuhli issue). Anyway, it does a beautiful job! I got the 2215. I would recommend going up in filtration (bigger tank - more filtration).The only issue I had, I have to order the sponges for the filter online. I'm thinking of buying sponge stuff that I can cut since they seem to be really expensive. The bottom sponge is super tough but the white one after you wash it feels like it's going to disintegrate it.

I'm not totally surprised she did that with the way she would play with it and try to \""kill\"" it.

Lasted about as long as the first before she ripped it open and started removing all the filling. So this is a great toy for my dog if you assume it will last maybe two weeks.

381,MH,"""I received my dog's dna results in about a week and a half from the time I mailed the swabs (that includes delivery time both ways)!!  That was much quicker than I was expecting.When I adopted my dog, she was listed as a Lhasa Apso mix.  I knew she was either Lhasa Apso or Shih Tzu (similar) mixed with something else, or at least I thought.  I finally broke down and ordered the dna test just to see.  I did not send a picture, because I did not want to think that they were going by the picture.  I knew that if the results came back and didn't include a breed with an underbite, flowing hair, tail curled over back, short legs, etc., then something would be wrong.  I honestly came to the conclusion after having her for a couple years that she was probably Lhasa mixed with Shetland Sheepdog.  She ran faster and jumped higher than any other Lhasa I had every seen (my last dog was a purebred Lhasa, and I knew several people with Lhasas or Shih Tzus).  Also, her hair on her chest and back of her legs seemed to grow like a collie.  Plus, she seemed to \""herd\"" kids when they played with her.Well, the results I got back were very surprising (not in a bad way).  There were only 2 breeds listed on the results.  They were both level 2, so I'm assuming she is 1/2 and 1/2.  The breeds listed were Lhasa Apso and Shih Tzu!!!  I guess she's just unusually fast and agile compared to others of those breeds that I've been around.  Someone at her groomer had once told me they assumed she was a purebred Lhasa.  I told them no, she was mixed with something else.  I guess the employee at the groomer was much closer in her opinion than I was with mine!  She has the personality traits of a Lhasa, which I have thought from the beginning.  Her nose is also longer (Lhasas have longer noses than Shih Tzus), and she's larger, so it seems like she has more of the Lhasa traits.It didn't matter what she is, I was just curious and tired of wondering.  I am glad I finally broke down and got this test.  I am very satisfied with the results I received.UPDATE:I am even more impressed with the company's customer service!  I emailed them yesterday to ask them if my dog's results meant that she was 1/2 Lhasa and 1/2 Shih Tzu or if maybe they both showed up because they are similar breeds.  I received a response from them later that afternoon.  They went further than I expected with their response.  First, even if breeds are close and one is thought to come from the other breed, they can tell the difference.  They said having two level 2 breeds usually does mean the dog is 1/2 and 1/2, but they looked at the raw data from the test results, and she is more like 40/60 lhasa/shih tzu.  I was very impressed with their quick response and their attention to detail.After hearing everything I've experienced with this, my mom is going to have her dog tested out of curiosity.""","Quick, accurate (I think) results",5

That's important especially if you have a big cat.  Second like the other review says,  the liners suck.  They do not stay in the pan, there is no extra to lip over the edge and secure.  You'll have to buy some larger trashbags which are typically thinner.  Third it's a leap to get into.  LITERALLY.  My cats didnt tell me this but when one and the other came out with poop on their feet, I figured the jumping in blindly was the reason.  However, I fixed that by buying a two step foot stool for them, which they quickly adapted to.  But now to the last problem.  The lid.  I have a pair of 18 pound cats.  They could not easily fit through the hole.  Maybe this is great for kittens or small cats but for me it was a joke.

So, I was a bit worried about putting this together when I got it, but it came with it's own wrench (?) of sorts, like the ones from IKEA.  First, the covering, which I think is some sort of furry fabric? is really nice, it's a golden white color and it's very soft.  I wanted it for my second cat who is a &#34;Tree&#34; cat, as opposed to my other cat who is a &#34;ground&#34; cat.  I figured it would give him a safe place to get away from my other cat ;-) I managed to put it together in about 10 minutes and feel it's pretty sturdy.  I put it against my couch in a corner for support and use my 3lb bar bells on the bottom corner of the base to anchor it.  It does wobble a wee bit (just a bit) if my cat jumps on the top very quickly but not enough to scare him off or even create a rocking effect.  It took a while for both cats to like it, to encourage them, I put cat nip on each shelf as well as gave them their treats on it.  I mostly feed my cats wet food so when I give them a bit of dry food, they go crazy and would climb almost anymore.  I now feed my &#34;tree&#34; cat on the top shelf where he also sleeps a lot and my other fat cat on top of the nook area.  The ONLY drawback is I wish they had made the shelves longer for lounging. I don't understand why they couldn't have added about 2 more inches on each sides of the shelves - including the base - so it would be a rectangle and not a square.  But?

404,Eagle Vision,"BackgroundWe have a Brick house on top of a hill with flat terrain.  However, I want to restrict my dog from going into the forest, the neighbor's yard and street.  Our dog is a 6 year old Bichon Frise that is house trained.  He goes to the front door when he needs to make a bathroom break and he will circle us if he needs to go, if we are not in the Foyer.SetupSetup was rather easy.  The menu system is intuitive and simple to follow.  The dog collar comes with 2 rechargeable CR123 batteries.  I put the controller near the garage window, away from electromagnetic interference.  The zone is more of an ellipse for my property but it covers the danger areas for my dog.Using the transmitter for tone, only, the user places flags to mark out the perimeter.  It serves as the physical landmark for the play zone.  A warning tone occurs as you approach the boundary and a correction is administered if the pet goes beyond it.  This lasts for 30 seconds according to the manual but I did not test that lockout feature.The system involves a several week training interval to get the pet to adapt to the sound, feedback and flag markers.  My dog picked up pretty quickly that it was not to go beyond the tone alarm.  I set the correction to a medium setting.UseThe system works well for our pet, when all he needs is a potty break from the house.  I just place the collar on at that time.  Obviously, I don't use this for walks around the property.  He is usually on a leash for that.ConclusionThis is a well made system and will work on properties with a less robust landscape.  The setup is critical.Highly recommended as a low cost alternative to an invisible fence.",Works for our little Bichon Frise,4

407,Kimichanga,"I've looked endlessly at reviews and websites (martins cages, Critter nation, Super pet cages (multi for ferrets), The prevue hendrix)and finally decided on this cage because it was big and cheap...well, cheaper than others that is. This cage is HUGE and the picture doesn't do justice. I didn't think it was going to be that big and spacious. I had my 3 lil feeder rats in a dog carrier for 5 days until this cage arrived...I put tubes in the carrier with their hide box and a hammock (YES IT ALL FIT) and they adjusted well and was very happy due to the fact that they were living with 25+ rats of all sizes/ages in a cage with no shelves or toys or anywhere to hide when I purchased them. As soon as I put this cage together, they were exploring like crazy and you can tell they were very grateful! This cage is amazing and easy to clean...the only problem I had is that it's pretty hard to hang toys and things since the cage is deep and I have long arms and it's still kind of hard to get back in there as I can only work with one hand in there at a time. The cage was really easy to put together and instructions are on point! I had the same problem as other reviewers about zip ties. When you lock the cages in place according to their loops that connect, there is a gap or opening that a curious rat can most likely fit through if they really wanted to, so I zip tied all 4 corners in the mid section btwn the connecting loops...once you get the cage you will know what I'm talking about. The pros far outway the cons so there's no reason to not purchase this cage as you can modify it to your likeing anyway. I like how you can carry it to the shower for a thorough cleansing and it's not heavy unless your small or pregnant that is. The pan is very deep so if you have a ratty that likes to throw bedding out or just plain mischeivious then I don't see a problem with this pan and I really don't understand how rats can chew through the bottom pan?! Maybe I will update this review in a few months to tell how it's holding up. My rats are very grateful as they came from a bad situation and they are still opening up to me after a week and they are too scared to try and escape so they don't do anything to damage the cage but then again I just put it together yesterday so an update will be made months from now or sooner. Overall this cage is perfect for rats and possibly sugar gliders and maybe a chinchilla but I don't see a ferret living in here as it's too small and the ramps might not hold a ferret too long. I've had ferrets in the past and they had a HUGE cage so I just don't see 2 living in here...maybe 1 but not even that. Chinchillas like to jump and IDK if this is suitable for a chinchilla. It can def hold baby rats though but like I said you'd need zip ties. Cleaning the cage is a breeze for me, the only downfall is you have to move stuff around like the ramps get in the way but that's about it. I use puppy pads at the bottom that they pee on and they poop in a litter box so it's easy for me to clean and they don't soil the ramps or shelves but that could change in the near future.",GREAT cage,5

412,L. Gildart,"I review a lot of cat products. It wasn't like it was my life's calling - I just have rescue kitties who have health issues, and I do not have a lot of money, so I end up consulting with vets and researching and trying a lot of things while trying to keep the major expenses to a minimum and the cats as healthy as possible. I asked to review this kitten litter trainer because I had an older cat whom I had adopted as a hospice case from a rescue that mostly does TNR. I had him for six months, and when I ordered this, he was starting to not be able to get into a regular litter box.I never got the chance to try this with him (rest in peace, Glitch, and thank you for letting us love you for a while), but in a conspiracy of amazing timing, there was one tiny Miss Pixel who needed a home right at the moment that our Commander Fluffypants was most distressed about not having a companion animal. Tiny kitten arrived in time to try the tiny litter box.It is easy to set up. Self explanatory except for the part where you need to put the side of the liner with the line down the middle UP. The instructions are clear on that, btw, but it is something you will have to read them to know. It is small - like around the size of a lasagna pan - and the side cut out is very helpful to the kitten (seriously, she is tiny).It took a while and some trick to get her to use this box, though. I think the pellets may have been intimidating at first. I ended up putting a thin layer of World's Best Cat Litter on top of them, and she was willing to go in and do her thing after that. The pellets and litter lasted the full week, as advertised, and the box is wicked easy to clean. Seriously, the liner box is very very smooth. Nothing sticks to it.Once you have the box, the pellets and pads are not THAT expensive as long as you don't have a cat with the kinds of health issues that implicate litter box use. Glitchy had diabetes along with his cancer for a while, and he overwhelmed every kind of litter in existence except the dustiest grossest clay clumping stuff. Before we had him, we had sweet Mary-Kate who had CRF and would not walk on anything that bothered her feet, because they hurt. I do not think this type of litter would work for them. But for Miss Pixel, it's great. My plan is to try to transition Commander Fluffypants as well, since this is the first litter I've ever used that really does not track.",Expensive - But If You Really Want No Tracking,4
413,Roof,"I have owned this tank for awhile now, and what a great tank it is.Since this tank is 2 feet long, you can have different fish in when compared to a normal tank of this gallon capacity. I happen to have one young convict cichlid and three tiger barbs,you would be pleasantly surprised about how happy they are. My cichlid is about 2-3 inches long and the barbs are about 1 inch, they have plenty of room. People on the internet will try to make you scared about how many fish you put in your tank, or how big your fish are compared to your tank. Acting like high school kids about who is the better pet owner and if you do one thing wrong you are an animal abuser.Do not be worried about putting a 4 inch long fish in this tank by himself, he would be fine. Even the inch per gallon rule doesn't apply on a tank like this since surface area gives it superior oxygen and the length gives the fish plenty of room. In other words treat this tank more like it was a 12 gallon. I wouldn't suggest putting a five inch fish in here though, because it needs to be able to turn around easily, and the tank isn't too deep.The tank itself is great, filter is nice, nice subtle bow in the front, but if you don't like the bow you could set it up backwards.

For the past several years, though, I only buy the more durable types after hearing of some of the potential problems like choking or bowel obstruction.  I recently ordered two Nylabone Dura Chews for my large shepherd.  One was abacon-flavored hollow stickand the other was this regular-flavor wishbone.  My big guy is a bit coordination-challenged when he's trying to hold a bone with his paws while he chews on it.  He'll even bring one of the chews over to a family member to try to get them to hold it while he gnaws the end.  Not spoiled at all.  I'd hoped that the three protruding parts of the wishbone would make it easier for him to hold it himself.  Problem is, though, that he has absolutely NO interest in it.  He's completely crazy about the hollow stick Dura Chew; but even when I put it and his other favorite toys away, he still won't take the wishbone.  His older terrier sister is usually not allowed to have Nylabones because she's a chew-maniac and can destroy (and eat) them quickly.  I \""tested\"" the wishbone chew with her to see if she'd do her usual fast snatch-and-destroy with it.  I've never seen her turn one down; but she wouldn't even take it from my hand when coaxed.  Since there are other positive reviews, it actually sort of makes me wonder if something is just wrong with the batch that ours came from.  I left it laying out on the floor for several weeks.  Both dogs walked around it to avoid it.  I vacuumed around it.  Finally tossed it out.The only other issue that I have with it and the much-loved hollow stick Dura Chew is the size labeling.  I bought both chews in the \""Wolf Size\"" assuming that they would be the best option for my 100 lb fellow.  It turns out that the wolf-size is for 35 pounds and under (small wolf?).

The other 3 cats are females who are not too picky, though, there are a few foods they won't touch.The food itself has several impressive ingredients and it has a nice broth in every can. What I have also noticed is that this food doesn't have that \""fishy\"" smell or that \""sandy/gritty like\"" texture like so many of the other canned cat foods that are on the market.

My cat's won't usually eat any shredded canned foods, they like the ground/pate styles.Recently, one of my female cats, Sissy developed an allergy to one of her previously enjoyed foods and her front bottom lip swelled up (sometimes called a rodent ulcer) and I think this might be a good alternative for her as she hasn't had a reaction to this food. This food is more expensive than some, but, it's not as expensive as the Science Diet Prescription or the Royal Canin prescription diets for hypo-allergenic (though this food doesn't claim to be hypo-allergenic).Also, my 20lb., very picky Phatboy Cuddlecuss cat will only eat certain wet foods and he absolutely loves this, usually he will only eat Whiskas chicken, but he loves this one.Overall, I'd definitely purchase this canned food for my cats.

You do have to be careful about shaving cats around areas that their body comes between the clipper cover, such as their tail.  The clipper covers should ALWAYS be used but use extra caution around the legs and tail.  Our cats tails were thin enough to fit in between the clipper covers and the clippers came awfully close to their tail, almost cutting them.  The clippers overall are really good and it took us no time to shave our cats, maybe 30 minutes at most.  BE sure to keep the hair out of the clippers, don't let it build up and go against the direction of their hair growth.",Great for shaving Persian cat hair!,5

466,Amazon Customer,My 14 month old Great Dane was inhaling his food so I tried one of the stainless bowls with the bump in the center (it had worked pretty good when he was a puppy) but he was still finishing in 2 minutes max.  I got this Northmate Green Modern Interactive Dog Feeder on Tuesday. I poured his 2 cups of food all around in it and Jax looked at me like I had lost my mind.  I then took my finger and moved the food around a little bit and he started picking at it. (I guess he figured if the feeder didn't eat my finger it wasn't going to eat his snout).  It took him around 25-30 minutes to eat all of his food the first feeding.  Yesterday and this morning it took 20 minutes for him at each feeding.  I feed Taste of the Wild and the feeder holds the 2 cups with room to spare.  It could hold 3 cups easily maybe even more than that. I know kibble comes in all different sizes so the amount it holds may differ with the size of kibble.  The feeder is made of a hard plastic and it has little rubber feet but it will still slide.  I am currently putting it on my coffee table which has &#34;baby bumpers&#34; on all four sides...Jax pushes it around but it's not going to fall off.The feeder was a little pricey for me but it's working and he's eating out of it with no problem.

470,Ketty,"I got this box because I adopted a cat that would not cover her poop so my previous litter box,Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox, was no good. The poop would just sit there on top of the litter and stink up the whole room. For that purpose, this litter box has been pretty good at controlling odors but some smell still gets out when the door swings while the cat exits.I do love the size of this box though. The cat has a lot of room to maneuver and hide in. The clear flap allows the cats to see out so they feel safe. The plastic seems very sturdy compared to the cheap cat pans you can find in the department stores. I also like how the flap lifts up for easy scooping and has a handle groove on the door so you can easily bring the flap back down.My only major complaint and the reason why I am sending the litter box back is that the front side of the pan is way too shallow! My cats track a bunch of litter everywhere when they exit the box. I use Precious Cat clumping clay litter. With my previous CleverCat box, the cats barely tracked out anything at all because the litter would just fall on the lid. I could get a litter track mat for this box but putting the mat in front of the box entrance would take up more room and would make it an eye sore in my small living area. The litter box itself is already taking up a lot of room since it is so big.If you have no problems and have the extra money to get a litter mat or use heavy litter, then buy this, otherwise, try something else with a higher wall.",Biggest litter box I've ever seen with LOTS of room but litter tracks!!,3

489,Amazon Customer,"No major reduction in tartar but keeps it in check and the breath is perfect.My dog builds plaque like crazy so I was using another water additive and also doggy tooth wipes but switched to this because it uses sodium hexametaphosphate as the active ingredient for tarter/plaque control instead of chlorahexadrine or chlorine dioxide which are 2 more popular active ingredients for dog dental care. All 3 ingredients work well to reduce plaque, bacteria and reduce tartar buildup, but the latter 2 have the propensity to stain teeth brown after continued use while the sodium hexametaphosphate does not. Staining would probably be minimal anyway, but just a personal preference of mine to have teeth as bright as possible.It works as well as the other water additive I used to use, tropiclean water additive, dog's breath is clean, plaque and tarter are under control. So far my dog seems to prefer the taste of this to the other one but i think that's really a dog preference, i notice in reviews of each some dogs like it some don't.I used the directions to figure out the proper ratio for my dog's water bowl, directions are: 1 tsp. of Nylabone Liquid Tarter Remover with 32 oz. of water, so I use a 1/4 tsp for my toy dog's 8 ounces of water. With stuff like this i think it's really important to get the right ratio, why use too many chemicals if you don't have to, and you don't want to use to little or they won't get the benefits.

492,S. WIlliams,"We've got two large dogs and have tried many of the treats/bones that purport to clean teeth. These are similar to many, in that they are a small, semi-hard bone type treat. They took our dogs >5 minutes to consume and they seemed to really enjoy them. Were there teeth cleaner or breath better than before? Not noticeably, but they didn't seem to do any harm, either.We use these because I always think, 'Couldn't hurt.' But, besides giving dental treats like these, we also brush our dogs teeth regularly. (I try to do it every week, make sure I do it at least bi-weekly.) I think brushing is really important, not only for the health of a dog's teeth and gums, but also, if started while young, it helps establish comfort with having their people do relatively uncomfortable and personal things for them. That makes it so much easier in the long run, because you will, eventually, have to do things like give them pills or maybe even hand feed them, and having them already comfortable with handling of their mouth and paws and tails makes all those care items infinitely easier. And, makes your dog a better and more social companion overall.","Dogs Like Them, But Nothing Beats Brushing",3

494,A. C. Chitwood,"I love my Drinkwell Pet Fountain. My cat never tries to drink from the faucet now that we have this, and he drinks much more than he used to. I have a dog now too and he also loves the fountain. When we just had  the cat I had to refill it about every four to five days, and clean in every two weeks or so. Now that both the dog, and the cat are using it I got the 70oz. reservoir. My dog is 16lbs. and I now have to refill it every three to four days and clean it once a week. My dog gets hair and dirt and strange things in the water that my cat never did. This brings up the reason I gave four instead of five stars.Cleaning the fountain is a hassle. You can reuse the filters for a few times by running them under the tap water until it drains clean, which is helpful. But the process of cleaning the fountain itself is a pain. I haven't bought the special cleaning accessories, but I've seen them and don't think they would be of much help. I've found the easiest way of cleaning is to dissasemble the fountain and rinse in hot water. Then mix a sink full of 2 parts water to 1 part distilled vinegar and let soak for about 10 minutes. Another rinse through hot water and most of it is clean except the very bottom of the filter well and the very bottom of this thin cylinder well. Cleaning the filter well is relatively easy, get a dish rag or a sturdy paper towel and you should be able to wipe out the crud that builds up. Cleaning the thin cylinder well is a serious pain. I get a dull or unsharpened pencil and push a sturdy paper towel through and twist to get the bottom clean. A pipe cleaner would clean the sides, but I haven't seen one with enough bristles on the bottom to get the crud that builds up in this little well.Despite how annoying this is, I maintain two fish tanks and cleaning this fountain is a breeze compared to tank maintenance. I just wish the design hadn't included this little cylinder well since it doesn't seem to have a purpose and is a pain to keep clean.Over all a good product with potential to hold more water than it comes with. I strongly recommend if you have cats and small to toy sized dogs.My mom got the Petco brand pet fountain for her cat and it seems to be easier to clean, but there is no reservoir that fits it so it only holds enough for one or two cats or toy breed dogs.

The initial smell is quite a strong perfume smell, but it goes away after a day.Suggestions:1) Buy a lot of this stuff. You're supposed to really soak the carpet and the padding underneath. The initial pet spot usual is wider under the carpet, so really soak the area, and a little around it.2) Buy more than you need. If you've found a spot, there are probably two or three.3) Rub it in. Once you've soaked the top, use the flat bottom of the bottle or a drinking glass and rub the stuff into the carpet. This will give you even, deep coverage.4) Give the whole area a sniff test afterwards. This is wear the second bottle comes in handy.

My solution is to relocate the laser toy so it does not \""aim\"" at something that may harm the cat and to keep any and all breakable objects out of your cats reach at all times.When my hands are available and I'm free, I just set it to manual mode and lead them to (other) new toys or treats and we all have fun!!Always supervise your cats and children when they play with any toys, especially lasers.  NEVER, EVER aim the laser into their eyes and TAKE IT AWAY and even TURN IT OFF, if you catch them staring into it.  They'll learn that if they look into it, the fun will stop and they won't look into it again.  You'll save their precious eyes that away!  Store it in a location where children cannot access it and pets can't accidentally turn it on.""","Finally, a hands-free laser toy for your cat!!",5
502,"""Becky in NOLA \""Becky\""""","I know feeding my dog Purina is controversial. Well, I've fed her the expensive stuff, solid gold, Canidae, blue buffalo, etc. Izzy is a rescue dog who was about 15 months when we got her. From almost day one  for the last five years. she had stomach issues and allergies. About once a month she'd get colitis and have horrible mucous poo. I know, gross, imagine how we felt. She is beautifully house trained but the poor thing would be whining by the door, running out, having horrible runs. Around Thanksgiving of last year she got really sick to the point of being clinically dehydrated. We took her to the vet and she had to be hydrated with the fluid under her skin. Many dollars of tests later and they still had no idea, she didn't have worms, Pancreatic infection etc, we had a whole lot of what she didn't have. I was desperate and did a web search for food made in the USA for dogs with stomach issues.We started feeding her the Purina the first of Dec. She has had one, one bout of diarrhea since then, and I think it's because I gave her some duck liver at christmas and her tummy just can't handle any rich food. Between the Purina Pro Plan and the tsp of active culture yogurt daily she is doing great. Her coat is shiny, she gained a pound, she has energy and she has stopped the once or twice a month diarrhea episodes.Purina Pro Plan sensitive stomach has really worked for Izzy. She is healthy, happy, and her stools are nice and solid. I wish we had tried it years ago, but I was put off by all the bad press Purina has. I don't know about the rest of their products, but I recommend this to anyone who's dog is not doing well with other foods.",Finally Izzy has healthy poots,5

505,Miss B,"My indoor kitty loves to rub so when I saw this while wasting time when I should have been studying, I thought: He will LOVE this! As soon as it arrived at my house, I slapped cat nip into it (included) and I used the double sided tape to attach this to the wall. I showed my boy the groomer and gently nudged him into it so that he would get the idea. He was completely and utterly unimpressed after a sniff or two. The groomer spent the next several days on the wall without so much as a sidelong glance from my cat. Finally, I did something really embarrassing..... I showed him how to use it by rubbing my own face on it.You read that correctly. I got down on my hands and knees and rubbed my face on it while he looked at me like I was an idiot. And I have to admit, he had a point. Had my boyfriend walked into the room at that time, he probably would have had me committed.That being said, about 20 minutes later I heard the rattle of those plastic nubs against my cat's teeth. He loves the crap out of this thing now! He even loves it as a team sport: he rubs his face on the groomer and I sit behind him rubbing his back. This is a daily ritual at our house now and I have never bothered to add more catnip to it since there wasn't any discernible difference in my cat's enjoyment of the groomer. Also, it is very easy to clean the fur out that builds up in the bristles. I just use the hose attachment and vacuum the fur which slips off quite easily.It was a good purchase and when I get a bigger house, I will buy more. Where I live now, I have only one corner that was feasible to attach this thing to.For people having trouble getting their cats to use this, my advice is: 1) Have patience. 2) Show them how to use it. 3) Pick a new corner to hang it if there is still no interest.And finally, once you have a location that you know the groomer will live permanently then I recommend screwing it to the wall. If your cat likes it, then the double sided tape will not be able to withstand the ridiculously vigorous grooming from a happy cat for more than a few months.",The indoor cat loves it!!,5
506,LS,"Just received this brush in the mail a couple days ago, and I'm very pleased with it. I originally was looking into the Furminator brand brush, but I wasn't a fan of the price and there are issues with changing the blades (apparently, you have to change their blades periodically, but they either don't sell the blades by themselves or they are way too expensive to replace). Well, I figured I'd give this brush a shot since it looked pretty similar and was way cheaper. Because I haven't used the Furminator, I can't give any comparison of the two, but I can say that I don't even need to try the other brush because this one works as well as any brush possibly could. It gets the job done and does it well.I highly recommend it. The package says it works for any dog or cat hair, short or long.",Does what it's supposed to do,5

I don't know if this is a real FURminator or not but I can tell you that I felt the comb and it's not really sharp. I did not restrain the dog at all when I combed her so if it hurt she could walk away. The dog has pretty sensitive skin, but when I combed her she just sat there for about 10 min. The fur just kept coming! If it hurt the dog she would have walked away. The blue button is very helpful in getting the fur out of the comb, it makes a little hair ball that is easy to pick up and toss. I have been using this comb on the dog for about 4 weeks now and the shedding has really gone down. I can vacuum every 24/36 hours now, the baby on the floor is not longer covered in dog hair, we can pet the dog and not inhale a fur cloud, and on 2 occasions different people have seen the dog and remarked about how good she looks, and she feels softer and cleaner in-between baths. Over all I am so happy I bought this comb it has really saved me time in cleaning, and de-furing all my clothes and my toddler's clothes before leave the house. The dog seems to enjoy being combed, I just have to hold her loose skin taught to get her neck area. this was a great buy and 1/2 the price of PetCo.

I'd been having a hard time getting the cats to eat their dental treats but now that it's &#34;fun&#34; they seem more apt to enjoy them.  They don't really chase it around the house like I was hoping (for the exercise) but it does occupy them and they go into &#34;stalk-attack&#34; mode with it so they're definitely getting some mental stimulation out of it.  One of my cats will actually pick up the ball by the small opening and carry it around like a dog playing fetch...so funny.Here are the only cons that I'm experiencing:1.  It's made of durable plastic which is very noisy going across the tile floor.  Carpet is totally fine.2.  There are two openings.  A big one to stuff the treats through which then gets covered up by the colored cap and then a smaller one for the treats to come out of during play.

531,J. Thurman,"I've washed my dogs at Wag'n'Wash a few times, and the power blowers they provide do not put out any warmth at all, making it impossible to dry a Sheltie who has only been towel-dried.  This B-Air 1 puts out enough warm air that you can feel the hose warming up under your fingers, but you can't feel any heat on your hand if you blow the air against it.  Which is perfect IMO - no risk of injuring the dog, but an unbelievably speedy drying job.  It made short work (about 10 minutes on low power) of drying my towel-dried Sheltie, and by using the wide slotted attachment and a slicker while drying, I was able to avoid the knots in his coat that I usually get when I use a human hair dryer on him.Regarding the noise, it's really pretty quiet for a high-power blower.  I used it inside a small bathroom with the door closed, and didn't have to raise my voice at all to maintain my reassuring chatter with the dogs while drying their coats.  The Sheltie is used to going to the groomer, so he's familiar with blower noise.  But my short-haired dog who doesn't go the groomer, and who attacks the vacuum cleaner, is okay with it too.  I guess a dog who hasn't had any exposure to noise might need some desensitization help to get used to it without developing a fear response.  But I've found that just going ahead and doing what needs to be done, talking in a happy friendly low voice in a continuous stream of comfort words, and not feeding into their fear, generally works best with my own dogs when it comes to getting them used to something new.  (Plus I don't understand why a customer would downgrade her rating of the product just because her own dog is skittish about it -- that doesn't reflect on the quality of the product, but on the preferences of the dog and its handler and how they choose to react to the world around them.)I looked into buying a professional quality human hair dryer for the dogs, which costs about the same as this pet blower, but those couldn't possibly dry the long-haired breeds as quickly as this B-Air 1.  Plus you have to keep your hand between the dryer and dog to make sure the heat isn't burning their skin when you use a human hair dryer.  This is the first pet grooming blower I've seen that contributes a small amount of heat to the drying process - stroke of genius.  Amazing how little heat is needed to cut the drying time from 45 min. down to 10 min.  And for the price, it simply can't be beat.  Since it also appears to be well constructed with easily removed washable filters to keep the dog hair out, I'm hoping it will last a good number of years.",Amazing blowing power plus enough warm air to REALLY speed drying.,5

551,Mr. E,"What can I say, I am a fish addict?  I originally had a little 2.5 gallon tank I picked up for $13 new on my desk at work, but it was so small it was difficult to put any filtration into let alone a decent heater.The nice thing about this little tank is that it has the filter built in and it is SILENT.  The only time it ever makes any noise is if a bubble or piece of sand finds its way into the filter.  If you turn it on and it makes noise, you just need to rotate the pump a little bit so it isn't rubbing against the side.The water flow IS a little bit strong, but that can be VERY easily fixed by placing the pump on the lowest setting and putting a small $0.99 filter bag over the outlet.  With the filter bag, I can easily keep a little dwarf puffer without much fuss.  If you decide to keep a salt water tank (not recommended, but possible) the high flow can be a very good thing.The light is decent and attractive to look at.  I have some chain swords and a marimo growing fairly well in the tank.The only note that I can give is that the filter is sensitive to sand.  If you plan on putting sand in the tank, put a filter bag over the vents of the pump to keep sand out of it.This is a great little tank.

I vacuum pretty often anyway so the crumbs don't bother me.  Just check below your furniture every now and then since this thing could flick some food several inches during a crazy spin.The major appeal of this device is that you can adjust the opening.  Not all dog food is the same size and I love that I can adjust it to fit her food.  In fact the first few days I left the opening pretty wide just she gets used to it but I've been narrowing it down since she's actually figured out how to spin it to get the food out quicker.I love that this is dish washer safe and so far feels extremely sturdy.

The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time.  I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it.  As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres.  The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us.

Also, try to keep the poops outdoors, as this will cut down on the cleaning hassle significantly.My dog was initially reluctant to use this (she was never trained on puppy pads, just outside grass), but I found that if I led her to it with a leash and just hung out on it, she would eventually go. Now she uses it during the day when I'm at work, no problem!I like the length of the grass, it's nice and short which makes it much easier to clean. The tray is pretty basic, nothing fancy. I do with it was another color other than black so I could see how dirty it was, but oh well. For the price it's great!UPDATE:I've had this for almost two years now and it is no longer possible to keep the grass from smelling for more than a day or two. I highly recommend getting these washable puppy pads http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B3W6C8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00My dog is so used to going on the tray that she didn't even blink when I made the switch.

Cage was easy to put together, once we employed the use of a hammer for a little extra muscle..... Levels and ramps can be adjusted for size / number of animals.The only negative:  the wheel / ball which comes with this cage is not well thought out.  It is too large to fit through the door, so it must be put in the cage before the wire sides are attached to the base.  That makes cleaning sort of a hassle, and a ball gets dirty quickly!  We threw the ball out, and use our own, which does fit through the door.ALSO:  the ball is not solid - it's wire.  That's not good for rats, and many other small animals.  If you choose to use the wheel for pet rats, you'll have to cover the wire with duct tape or ?????? something......In short, this cage is very practical.

646,Angela Streiff,"""I have 3 large dogs who drink a lot of water every day, Prior to buying this Bergan dog watered, I just used a very large water dish. During the warmer months, I was filling the bowl easily a half dozen times a day, Our largest dog, a 75lb lab could drink one whole bowl in a sitting when he came inside from playing in the backyard. Our family cat also seems to prefer drinking the water from the dogs bowl rather than his own dish. So no matter how often we were filling their bowl, it was just never enough. Inevitably at some point one of the dogs would come over to get our attention, so to bring us towards their bowls wanting them filled again.When I saw this Bergan dog waterer, I figured if it works, it would be exactly what we needed. I bought the 3 gallon model and have been so glad I did ever since. Now it only needs filled every other day (or so). For a family with smaller dogs, or less of them, this waterer will hold enough water for days probably. It's very simple to use. Simple pop the tank off the back, fill with water, screw the top back onto the tank and make sure the little hold is covered with its cap. Pop tank back into the tray and then reach under to the cap and remove the plug that's covering the water hole. The tank will fill with water and keep it filled with water as your pets drink.At first my dogs were a little confused by the \""glugging\"" sounds made by the tank as the water would drain and air bubble would rise inside, but after about 2 days they never cared about it again. Now they will drink and drink even with the tank making the noise as is fills up with air. The dish tray is deep enough that it keeps water from spilling out, but not so deep that small dogs would have an issue drinking out of it. It's quite sill resistant, as I've found from my kids and pets bumping into it time and time again. It stays upright and doesn't leak. If anything ever happened to this one, I wouldn't hesitate at all to pick another one of these up. Highly recommended!""",Finally a way to keep the dogs water bowl filled,5

Luckily we were on a little side street with no car traffic.She quickly got over her fears and now loves the freedom of romping around on our walks. The housing, by the way, held up just fine to being dragged behind a terrified puppy- just a few nicks here and there.Even though my puppy will only grow to weigh a fraction of the 110 pound rating this leash offers, I like the security in case of lunging, and as of 10/04/2013, she only weighs 30 pounds, she does not seem to mind the tension on the leash- I don't know if leashes with different weight ratings have different tension settings or if they're all set to the same tension.The brake and brake lock are located on the handle in easy to reach and activate positions, and supply an immediate and solid stop to the leash. The handle itself is comfortable to hold, and the whole thing weighs very little, so isn't tiring on long walks.On a side note, I received the 4 pocket saddle for the leash as a gift from a relative- and it's great!

685,"""S. Hamon \""Super Mom\""""","""I don't mind paying a lot of money for a dog harness if it is worth it.  I think this harness costs more because they did use better materials, but for the wrong reasons and in the wrong places.  The so-called mesh areas are not really mesh at all but rather a mesh-looking material over top of another material defeating the purpose of using mesh at all.  There is a stretchy spandex-like material that goes underneath of your dogs chin...this is a nice material, but it serves the harness no positive uses...(1) it quickly gets extremely dirty, (2) because it is kind of silky, gets snags on it, and (3) eventually stretches out making the harness look cheap.The nylon band that goes around your dogs chest feels like it was dipped in some hard glue...it has no flexible qualities what-so-ever!  Go to your local petstore and feel the difference between a $5 leash and a $30 leash (the flat nylon kind)...with how much this cost, you would expect that softer, more flexible feel of the $30 leash...yet it is hard.  You would also think that this band would be narrower for an XS, which I ordered...nope!  It is about 3/4\"" thick and therefore digs into my dogs chest when she lays down, the band itself and the ridiculously large plastic clips.  Because of that, I was always putting it on for walks, then taking off when back inside.  Having to do that is a pain and is why this thing went in the trash.You can't even adjust the part that goes around your dogs shoulders/chest...it is that meshy crap.  Horrible design because there are a lot of dogs out there with large barrel chests (daschunds for example) where a larger size will be needed to fit the chest, but then the front part is huge because it is not adjustable.  Just an all around horrible design.  Try to find one and try it on your dog before purchasing.""",Too expensive for what you get...,2

It had the 5 stage filtration with UV, and other comparable units were selling for way more.  The reviews I found on this one were good, so I decided to go for it.The instructions are totally worthless.  They are very poorly (and quite comically) translated to English, so much of it doesn't make sense.  That being said, I found it very easy to figure out how to set this thing up on my own, which took about 20 minutes.It came with sponge liners for each tray, but no carbon or other media.  I did find a combo pack on Amazon for bio-rings, ceramic balls, and carbon, and 1 pack was enough for this filter.This filter surprised me at how quiet it is.  I figured it would be at least a little noisy for its size, but it's nearly silent.  I have been running this on a 75 gallon cichlid tank, and my water has never looked to clear.

692,K. Zuppe,"Some background information: I have a 4-year-old, 23 lb. male pug. I purchased the Small size, and I feel like it's the perfect size for my smaller dog.My poor dog seemed to be bored during the day while I was at work, so I purchased three treat-dispensing toys for him: this,PetSafe Busy Buddy Twist 'n Treat Dog Toy, Medium, andStarmark Treat Dispensing Pickle Pocket for Dogs. All three are perfectly-sized for my dog. I have not yet used the Pickle Pocket, but while he enjoys the Twist n' Treat toy, I personally prefer this one.I feed my pug a cup of food per day, and I usually pour a little less than half into this toy, and then pour the rest into his food dish. This way, both the toy and the dish hold a pretty decent amount of food... but I've found that he actually prefers working the food out of this toy, to eating straight from the dish! So I have to assume that he enjoys it. He learned how to use it pretty quickly, too-- all I had to do was smack it a couple times, to show him the kibbles that fell out (which he quickly scarfed), and within a minute, he was using it on his own.My only complaints are:#1: I wish it was easier to pour food in & out from the toy. It's a pretty lengthy process for me to pour a handful of kibbles into the top hole, shake the toy a bit to slide the pieces into the toy, and repeat. Likewise, it's a bit annoying to have to slooowly shake out all the kibbles from the side hole when I want to clean the toy.#2: Speaking of wish, I wish it was a bit easier to clean overall-- maybe if the base could unscrew around the green/purple pieces? It's not too difficult, but I always worry about whether or not I've rinsed out all the soap.Overall, this is an awesome toy that he enjoys playing with! It holds a pretty good amount of kibbles/treats, and it takes my pug at least half an hour, if not more (usually more), to empty the whole thing.",Great food-dispensing toy!,5

With this bowl, a meal that would typically take 15-20 seconds to eat now takes upwards of 1-2 minutes! What an incredible difference! I was pleased by the fact that my dog took to the bowl immediately and didn't seem to have any issues with having to eat differently :) The bowl is well constructed and appears as though it will last a long time. The non-skid rubber feet work better than most I've seen, most likely because the thick durable rubber is grooved, making it really grip whatever you set it on. To give an idea of the size of the bowl, I feed 1 cup of average size kibble soaked in 1/2 cup of hot water for each feeding and the bowl is the perfect size for it.

A year later, I tried it again with my new Mini Shnauzer pup and it's a total win!

She patiently kicks or head butts the ball along and the kibble comes out a few nuggets at a time. She's never tried to chew the ball open, but we are careful to take it away as soon as she's done using it to make sure she doesn't start chewing on it. For the safety of your pet, I'd always suggest supervising your dog while using this. If you have a heavy chewer like some of the reviewers, this ball is probably not for you.

It definitely makes a good seal from what I can tell, it has a rubber o-ring gasket that goes around the lid. The gasket is a little loose so it sometimes comes off when taking the lid off, but isn't a big deal. This tub is great because it stacks well if you have multiple types of food/containers.The only drawback to this tub is the price. It's definitely the most expensive animal food container you'll find. I watched this product for over 6 months before I found it below 40$, which is still really expensive.

It's packed in styrofoam, so virtually impossible to get out otherwise. I would still recommend a soft surface. The box has a description on this process. The bowl itself is raised to shoulder level (for the cat), and is wide and easily accessible. It has a pronounced edge on the inside, but it is not sharp, and it is not overhanging, making cleaning easy, and food stays in the bowl.

764,S. Ortega,"I struggled in the beginning to get my Eclectus to eat this. I bought this food at the advice of my veterinarian. My eclectus also gets fresh organic fruits, veggies, bean mix and small amount of  nuts everyday. Fruits, bean mix and veggies are the main staple of his diet. He also had a tendency to want to eat sunflower seeds and other seeds only, which is not good for Eclectus to over eat. seeds. Especially not sunflower seeds. So, when taking him to the vet, my vet found that he was a bit low in weight and had a little bit of high liver enzymes. He asked if I was giving him pellets. I was giving him the natural Zupreem pellets but he didn't want to eat them. So what i did to get him to eat these is:First Week:.  I cut up the pellets and mashed it up with the juice from the blackberries I mixed in his favorite fruit. His favorite fruits are blueberries, pomegranate and blackberries. So I would squish the blackberry juice for example, all over the pellets to let them soak up the juice and mash it all up. Also left a few pellets in their usual size but let them soak up juice. Then I threw in the rest of the blackberry in with it. At first he would just eat the parts of the blackberries he could pick out. (I still continued to let him have seeds)Second Week: I cut pellets in half ( because he won't bite into nuts or pellets that are too hard) But I no longer mashed the pellets up.  He was picky so I continued the same thing ( Also I fed a few to my dogs and when he saw them eating it and heard the crunch crunch, he tried to pick up his pellets and then threw them down) (I ate a few myself, I have to say they are tasty and taste like sunflower seeds with no salt)Third Week: I began just soaking the pellets in his blackberry juice. (Juice of the blackberry only) ....continued his sunflower and seeds, but less of them (I had to go slow taking away his sunflower seeds because he actually got moody when I didn't give them to him)Fourth Week: Continue the same as third week but put less juice of the blackberry. (Really went down on seeds, like just a few)Fifth Week: By this time I cut only some of the Harrison's pellets up and left some the normal size. Then late at night I put a bowl of frozen Harrison's so by morning they were ready to eat.Sixth Week: All of a sudden early morning I heard him chomping away on the pellets. I couldn't believe it!! By the sixth week he doesn't eat seeds anymore.By the sixth week he was ready to for a new bag! Keep the bag frozen in your freezer and it will last the six weeks. But if you just put them in the fridge this big bag only lasts up to 10 days.Note: My vet says he is alot more healthy and very good weight. But, I did find he was getting a bit hyper and aggressive. My vet said it may be the spirulina in the Harrisons becuase some Eclectus act like that when they eat spirulina. So what he had me do is give him less of the Harrison's and add a little bit of the Zupreem Pellets or RoudyBush. He said if he takes the RoudyBush, I can give him RoudyBush instead if I want to, but he still thinks the Harrison's is much more healthy.I do have to say I can see an improvement in his color and he does have alot more energy since eating Harrison's.  When I first got him, he didn't want to move around much or climb any of his toys on his jungle gym. Now? Oh my gosh he climbs to the top like a little monkey!Will continue buying Harrisons I am very happy with him and so is he!","Took awhile but by the end of the bag, he liked it!",5

But when I decided to clean up our family's diet it occurred to me that it didn't make sense to spend extra money on a healthy natural dog food and then turn around and feed my dogs something equivalent to a bacon donut.They resisted at first.  The first time I offered them a fruit flavored treat, I had them all sitting in a row and, as if on cue, they all spit out the cookies in unison and looked up at me with their best WTF faces.

804,P. Sorornejad,"""I was turned on to the Blue Buffalo brand by the trainer at the training class I signed me and my pup for.  He is my new little fur ball so I have been very cautious about what he eats and the type of foods that he is exposed to.  I really didn't want to get into the habit of buying cheap foods and treats with random fillers and terrible nutrition, so I was always open to advice from the \""experts\"".  After doing some reading, I realized that Blue Buffalo is indeed one of the best most natural brands of Dog Foods available, so I jumped at the chance at trying these little treats for my in-training pup.  They are great! He absolutely loves them and will literally do anything for them!  He has already learned how to sit, lay, 'dance', 'paw', and stay!  The great thing is that they don't even smell terrible, they actually smell a bit like beef jerky.One thing I do recommend, is that if you have a smaller pup (mine is a shihpoo, 5months, 8lbs) cut these treats in half!  They are perfectly capable of eating them as a whole piece, but you totally get your money's worth by breaking them down in halves ;)""",My Pup Absolutely Loves These,5

The other two crates just didn't seem to be the right level of portability. Another I found had mixed reviews as well.I have a Shetland Sheepdog that is a tad oversized and a bit out of AKC specifications. He's taller and longer than most Shetlands; because of this, this is the 4th crate we've had for him. The first was enough for him as a puppy. I then bought thePetmate Vari Kennel Ultra Fashion, Medium, Bleached Linen/Blue. This second was perfect for him... until he grew to be longer and taller than anticipated. He was cramped and confined to a small space. I then bought a metal Midwest crate for having just at home. I don't tend to count this one because it's more than large enough, it just isn't portable. And now this one.I am pretty happy with this particular purchase.The pros to this crate:easy to assembleeasy to break downwhen broken down, it takes up only a few inches; so it is easily packableMesh fabric is high quality3 entrances (front, top and side)The cons:the smell; I'm not sure why the odor is as strong as it is, but this thing has a definite funk to itcould be easy to rip through for pets that don't enjoy confinementa touch pricy compared to theMidwest Canine Camper Day Tripper Soft Sided Crate, 18 Inches by 15 Inches by 16 Inches(sorry I can't link to the 31\"" long Midwest)To reiterate what it states all over the packaging and on their website, if you have a dog that scratches or chews and you think they will chew on the crate, this is NOT the crate to purchase. Go for the wire style as even with the plastic an overly anxious dog could hurt themselves chewing on the sides of the crate.It was packed in an easy to open cardboard box and the instructions are short and sweet and to the point. Also included is a starter on how to begin crate training.Over all this is a great product and I'm glad I bought it.""","Looks good, well made, stinks",5

819,Artistic Mind,"""Here's a full 411.ASSEMBLING:Very easy. 10/10 in ease. I was done in 10 minutes. I'm twenty and this was practically the only thing I ever put together myself. Trust me, it's a breeze. There's no trick to it, just follow the pictures and you'll be fine. TIP: Don't overcomplicate it for yourself by making this more than it is. Adults tend to overcomplicate things as they grow older. I don't know why, we just do. There are only 6 pieces to assemble - it can't be difficult. Look at the pictures for clarity.DOG CHEWERS:If your dog chews, I suppose they might try to chew the bed depending on how extreme the chewing is. I recommend you buying KONG toys and other heavy duty chew toys and keep them by the bed. When your dog starts to chew the bed, stop your dog and discipline him/her. When your dog looks like he/she is about to chew (or wants to chew) then give your dog a chew toy. It's all about prevention. If your dog is given nice toys to chew and play with, then your dog is less likely to chew the bed. If your dog does still prefer the bed, keep a watch on your dog and stop him/her every time he/she tries to chew the bed. Remember to discipline and don't use baby soothing voices like \""please stop\"". Also, to prevent chewing, you could spray the bed with sour apple spray. Ultimately it'll be your job to train your dog out of chewing destructively.DOG NAILS:Don't cut your dog's nails? Obviously sharp nails might scratch through the cover. I advise putting a blanket or pillow over the cover. I cut my dog's nails but I still keep a towel over the cover. Keeping a fabric over the cover is good for keeping the cover in good condition AND it is more comfortable for your dog.DOG OVERWEIGHT:This could be a factor in the bed's durability depending on how overweight your dog is. Make adjustments if you need to. If your dog's weight weighs down on the cover, keep something underneath the mat like a pillow. Ultimately you would want to help your dog lose weight and be healthy, but if your dog is the size of a terrier, and weighs the same as a beagle, you should buy a medium bed rather than a small bed. These beds were built for the dog's size and average weight. When choosing the bed, think of your dog's size & weight.MORE THAN ONE DOG:You should probably have a bed for each of your dogs. That's just what I believe. If your dogs get along and tend to sleep together, you should get the biggest size bed so that they can both share - because you can expect them to sleep together. If you have two large dogs (like two huskies) I'm not sure if your dogs can share a large bed. In that situation you'll definitely want a bed for all dogs. If you have a territorial dog, expect for a lot of training because your dog might become territorial with ALL the beds that you buy for your dogs.YOUR DOG DOESN'T LIKE THE BED:If your dog just doesn't take to the bed, it's time to train it to. It's just like training a child to sleep in their own room rather than with their parent(s). When your dog is about to sleep or rest, direct your dog to the bed until it's on the bed. Tell your dog to LAY DOWN (or whatever command you have for him/her). If this is too difficult, you can pick up your dog and lay him/her on the bed and tell your dog to LAY and to STAY. Do this as often as it takes until your dog gets used to using the bed. Once your dog is used to the bed, your dog will definitely appreciate it.HELPFUL TIP: NAME THE BED!!!Name the bed and refer to it as such. I named my dog's bed \""BED\"". Eventually your dog will learn the name for the bed so you can just say \""GO to BED\"" and he/she will go to their bed. This is also good for training your dog to use his/her bed more often. It's great because if your dog is in the way (say you're cooking in the kitchen or with guests), it gives your dog a place to go.DURABILITY:My dog is 30lbs and I have the medium size bed. When she gets a toy or treat, she RUNS to the bed, leaps, and lands hard on it. She's done this over 10 times in the week that I've had this bed and it's still in great condition. I would say this bed is very durable.KNOW YOUR DOG:In the end, that's the only thing that matters. This is a great bed at an even greater price. If you have to made a few cheap adjustments for prevention, then go for it. There's nothing wrong with that.Overall I love this bed and I highly recommend it.  It's almost 8 p.m. right now and my dog is resting comfortably on her bed as I type this review. Trust me, your dog will love this bed, and you will too.""",HERE IS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW,5

My Dobie hates this reduced formula with a purple passion. He will not touch it until he just can't go any longer without some food.

825,Adam Wood,"I've used Flexi retracting leashes for over a decade now, and I love them.  For me, they are much easier to manage than fixed-length leashes, and they offer my pooch Niki a lot more freedom because of the added length.  If you want a fixed-length leash from time to time, you can lock the length with the push button on the handle.  The leashes extend and retract very smoothly, and the softgrip handle is more comfortable to me than a regular plastic handle (which I also used for years).Each Flexi leash that I've owned has lasted for years.  Most times, I replace them only because the handle and case are beat up because of how I use it, not because the hardware breaks down.  I sometimes lock them in place and set the handle down on the ground (e.g. when I'm running to a garbage can but don't want to try and coax Niki to come with me), and little rocks will get inside when Niki inevitably starts walking without me.  :)  Getting dragged over the rocks marks up the case, and the rocks temporarily mess with the smoothness of the leash spooling, but the leash tends to recover within a walk or two.  Over years, though, that will eventually wear it out and I'll get a new one.I particularly like the unpainted hook.  I've had some in the past with black hooks, and the finish wears off and marks up fur next to it.  These hooks don't have that issue.Flexi seems to change the names and looks a bit every so often, but this Freedom design is similar to the softgrip one that I had before it.The only Flexi leash that I haven't loved is one of their retractable belt leashes.  The only thing that I didn't like was that the belt would catch the wind and start to oscillate and vibrate.  It would start humming, and I could feel the vibration in my hand (and I imagine that Niki felt it, too).  The cord leashes do not do that, and I couldn't be happier with mine.Overall, highly recommended.","Very comfortable grip, smooth retracting string",5

I also will break them up to use inside puzzle toys like theNina Ottosson  Tornado. The ingredients are excellent, and being freeze-dried, have a good shelf life compared to some soft treats. Also important to me is they are made in the USA. I'm refusing to buy treats made in China as many dog treats are.

Now, my dog is not very picky, but he definitely reacts with more enthusiasm in training according to how much he likes the treat being used. And boy, does he LOVE these!

I like to change it every couple of weeks to give him something new.I personally had absolutely no trouble putting this together, nor any troubles with it falling apart. It took me 15 minutes, tops. I can practically throw the thing around without it falling apart, so I am very unsure of why so many people have had these troubles. If you have a plan in your mind, it's simple to put this together. The only piece that tends to cause any trouble is the very last one you need to attach; just do it carefully, slowly, and it'll go on without the whole thing falling apart.It's actually pretty simple to wash. I don't take it apart unless I'm planning to change it's design. Instead, I just submerse the whole thing in water, let it soak, and then sit it out to dry before putting it back in my hamster's cage.I would not recommend using it as an external tunnel.

848,"""sprittzen \""spritz\""""","My cats are as  picky as anyone else's, but they're picky plebeian style.  That is, they won't eat the expensive stuff.  I've tried all of the brands over time, but only one flavor of one very expensive brand was accepted.  But with Friskies, the cats are happier than I am.First of all, I have bought several packs of various types of Friskies and the cats usually are happy with at least two flavors in the pack.  In this one, that pretty much changes to three of the flavors, but you're going to find a lot  of meaty by-products in each flavor, and very few that actually look or smell like fish at all.  And second, the cans are not always full, either.  Friskies has been doing this for years, long before the economy went haywire like it is now.  You figure you know how much to plan for a time-period, how much to buy.  But day by day, opening the cans, a goodly percent of them aren't full.  It's been an annoyance of lots of us in my own acquaintance all along.  I am not happiest about Friskies current notion of of &#34;nutritious&#34; either.One other of my hesitances to rave about these packaged selections comes from the &#34;pig in a poke&#34; family.  It is this:  We all of us know that one batch  to another, the recipe and ingredients used in each under the same flavor name changes, according to what the manufacturer got the cheapest for that period.  Sometimes the recipes for what you get turn out auspiciously, the cats think they're fantastic, and you too get a better feel for the company in general by appearance, etc. of the contents of the can.  Other times, that very same flavor is spurned by all the cats, and to you the content of the can seems to be entirely beef or turkey, if there actually is any fish in there at all.Too, I get the feeling that the least &#34;successful&#34; of their flavors, with the exception of one,  get put in the packaged deals. It wasn't always that way.  Not that they wouldn't try to market their less popular flavors that way, they would, as any other company.  But that the fish flavors, from Friskies, in general, were all popular.  Friskies has changed owners, though, and so this isn't the case anymore.  Also, the biggest selling flavors of any type cat food aren't going to show up in the packages, either.  Which is understandable from a business perspective, but not from that of the hopeful shopper.But all that aside, and also the fact that there is always at least one flavor in the four that the cats will hold out all day before eating, finally accepting that what they see is what they get today, they love this selection best.And I've seen other reviews for Friskies packs like this as having dented or damaged cans.  So I will state that never, in all the times I've got a packaged selection like this, have I seen any damaged cans, and while there may be one that's slightly dented, not badly, there won't be more. And the packaging itself is always perfect, in good condition.Finally, one highly important point to me:  Friskies, to my knowledge, has never been one of the companies that buy imported ingredients.  This alone, as long as it holds true, keeps me a loyal customer of theirs.",My trio prefers this mix,5

855,April A. Fleck,"""When I read about this toy, looked at pictures, and read the negative reviews from people whose dogs have chewed it up, I got the impression that it's a flimsy thin rubber ball.  It can be hard to tell online, and I couldn't find one in any local stores to look at in person.  I eventually decided to just try the large size out anyway to see for myself.When it arrived, I was surprised to find that the rubber is actually thick and feels very durable.  I've mainly used it for treats so far to keep my puppy interested in playing with it.  At first, he tried laying down and chewing on it, but then he figured out that rolling it around and throwing it made the treats fall out, so he hasn't chewed on it much.I've had it almost 3 months now and it's undamaged.  So far, my puppy isn't a huge toy destroyer... he's only ruined softer toys and ones with horrible quality (Hartz \""tuff stuff\"" I'm looking at you)... so it could just be a matter of time before he lays into it.  But for now, so far, so good.  It's held up well and he enjoys tossing it back and forth across the room.""",More durable than it appears!  (see updates in comments),5

I have primarily German Shepherds, but have dealt with malamutes as well. These toys are well designed and it takes a very long time for my dogs to finally chew them enough to poke holes in them, at which point the balls are taken away.What I love about this XX-large ball is that my dogs can fit in their mouths, including catching them, but because of the size, they are limited on their ability to &#34;chew&#34; on the ball. Also, because of the size, it won't fit under the couch, so I no longer have to crawl on all fours and dig their ball out from under the couch. Believe me, this gets very old after a while, especially when you have a talker that likes to bark in a high pitch sound to tell you his ball is under the couch again.I am very happy with these, and recently just purchased two more, because the first I tried, was dropped in a river and it floated away. It was too cold to let my dogs jump in after it, so I had to sadly let it go, but I was excited to learn it floats, because that means we'll have lots of fun with it this summer.",It's the perfect toy for a large dog!,5

It definitely keeps smells down.For me- it's just too big. My boyfriend bought it for me because we needed a new litter box. I always kept my cat's litter box clean by being meticulous about cleaning out clumps and feces many times throughout the day. With this litter box having the entire box covered often made me forget to clean the box because I didn't see that it was being used. I also picked it up a few times to move it near a trash bin or outside to hose it down and the top came apart from the bottom (probably too heavy to be carrying by the handle (I learned this the hard way) when the bottom came crashing down in my living room creating a huge mess. These are obviously my mistakes- not manufacturer's mistakes.What I'm getting around to is that this just wasn't the right choice for me. For other people it's great. My suggestion is when buying a litter box don't send you boyfriend to do it and keep in mind your own needs/habits. A simple plastic bin works fine.

867,"""Deborah Klapper \""mommy\""""","The product is a good idea, but it has so many issues that in the end it's a disaster.1) The difficulty with putting the pieces together. It takes forever, no matter how you do it. And you'll experience the delightful feeling of putting the last piece in and having the entire thing fall to pieces several times. The pieces also just don't fit together securely enough, if they snap together at all. The way the ramp attaches is absurd,2) The little plastic inserts. They were a nice idea, and in theory allow for color changing and whatever, but they fall out so much that I spent most of the time putting it together wishing the pieces were solid.3) The size. You'd think, for $10 and 42 pieces that you'd end up with a nice sized toy, but it's tiny. The size is actually a pretty good one, but shouldn't cost for than $5. It's also advertised as for hamsters and gerbils- no Syrian hamster or full sized gerbil is using this. It is, however, nicely sized for our mice.4) The lack of replacement parts. For something &#34;connectable and expandable&#34; it is completely impossible to buy, for example, extra tunnels (not that the 42 piece set even has tunnels, which is why this annoys me) or extra pieces. Replacement parts are simply non-existent, unless you buy another set. Which doesn't solve the tunnel issue, because the 60 piece set with tunnels is pretty much impossible to find, not to mention that I don't need another 60 pieces.

879,Katerina1059,"Upon moving last October, two strays have since adopted me. One, Henry, appeared here almost immediately, and he was looking a bit rough around the edges, but after months of consuming high quality cat food and some much need antibiotics from the vet, he looks a hundred percent better!  Anyway, we just happened to have a mild winter last year, so he did well nesting in my garage with his own special chair and bed.  Then in early spring, Josiah (AKA baby Jo Jo) appeared.  After getting a clean bill of health from the vet, I was happy, but concerned about having shelter for him this coming winter.  Of course, Henry and Jo Jo don't get along so well, so having a separate space just for Jo Jo became necessary.  Unfortunately, I have several indoor cats, so bringing him in isn't really an option.  But, of course, I want him to be warm and safe outside, so upon seeing the Kitty Tube and reading all the wonderful reviews, I ordered it and waited excitedly for the delivery.  Well, Jo Jo took to it almost immediately.  I placed it near the deck, under the large maple tree, near where he normally sleeps.  Upon removing the lid and placing him inside on the pillow, he shot out rather quickly, but later that day, I saw him closely inspecting it.  Before I knew it, he was curled up inside, grooming himself and rolling around on his back in sheer delight!  He just loves this thing, and I'm highly impressed with the quality of this house.  It is large and roomy, so if you have more than one cat, they could both fit comfortably as long as they're friends.  Even three could fit, depending on the size of the cats. This house is sturdy and has nice, thick insulation throughout.  Although I've only had it for a couple of weeks, the exterior looks very durable. I'm glad the entrance way is fairly small, so as to keep larger animals out and help kitty feel more secure.  The bed is quite nice, too.  I was telling my mom via phone about how much Jo Jo and I like the Kitty Tube, and initially, she yelled at me for spending the money on it (This is her normal reaction.)  However, after a minute or two, she said she wanted a couple of them!  She also has two strays, Gabrielle and Tippy and got by last year with some make-shift shelters that didn't last.  She also has two indoor cats, so she can't let the strays inside.  Anyway, I'm planning on ordering two for her ASAP!  Finally, I think the price for the item is very fair.  The fact that it's made of recycled material and made in the USA is definately a bonus!Update on 01/03/13:  the Kitty Tube is performing very well!  We've had a couple of nasty  storms with blowing and drifting snow and the Kitty Tube has stayed dry inside.  I recently added a small, flexible outdoor heating pad (also ordered through Amazon) and Baby Jo Jo has stayed nice and toasty on some frigid nights.  In addition, I also stuffed a medium sized microfleece blankey into the tube since it's gotten super cold to help trap the heat inside.  It is positioned to obstruct the entrance somewhat to help keep the cold air out, but, of course, kitty can still enter and exit without difficulty.  He seems to really like the addition of the blanket.  It makes me feel so much better knowing he is warm, safe and secure, even on very cold and stormy nights.  I'm so grateful for the Kitty Tube and my heated bed!  Well worth the cost for some real peace of mind.",It's a hit!,5

I have had mine for YEARS.4)  The round wooden handle is so much more comfortable than the variety of plastic handled flea combs I own.  Obviously, wooden handle combs cannot be soaked in water to clean them but I wipe down the tong part with rubbing alcohol and use Pledge on the handle.5)  I worried at first the wood handle on the flea comb would easily break-not so.  I dropped mine on a cement patio and on tile floors and they are very durable.BUT::: this Four Paw wooden handle flea comb has BLACK TONGS (picture of cat on it).

I used it everyday for a couple of weeks and saw my plants show new growth and perk up.  Now I use it about every other day and have been dosing for a little over a month now. I have low light plants like java fern, java moss, and some crypts and while they were staying alive, they weren't doing much.  With the flourish there is obvious growth and it does seem to keep algae growth down.  I am very happy with this product and have seen no ill effects to my fish!",Works!,5

Dogs will lick and scratch a spot open.  This product works great to treat those spots.  The spray is also good for paw pads, but I found I get quicker and better coverage with the flush.I bought another brand here on Amazon.  This was the first time I bought the gallon bottle. With this, I've been able to make my own flush and refill the spray bottle, following the diluting directions of 2 tsp per gallon.  For the price of the flush and spray, I was able to buy an entire gallon.  I've already made two containers of flush and one spray bottle, and it barely made a dent in the gallon. Even though the shipping on this product is higher than one would want, the overall value can't be beat.I added a cup of it to the lab's bathwater and let him soak, further treating his skin condition.I am thinking I can add some of this to the dog's shampoo, making my own chlorhexidine based shampoo for the skin conditions.  Vet Solutions is my favorite shampoo and does a good job on it's own.  Can it not be better with chlorhexidine for better control of skin afflictions?

Even if not, I still can use as a rinse and soak.I have not used this as a dental product.

The new cat, who is evidently not as aggressive as George would still be playing with her first one, which was in fine shape, but she kept tossing it in the cat box and this last time it landed in the poop, sooooo...into the garbage it went and out came a new one. I figure 10 bucks every three months for a toy my cat adores is worth it...but where or where is all that elastic cord? It's definitely not in his poop...so where is it?!!UPDATE: 8/5/13  Please note this last group I bought fell apart even more quickly than usual. I'm unsure where all the rubber string goes, I've not seen it in his poop, and he isn't blocked up. For sheer joy, he still loves them, but this last bunch began to unravel as soon as he got them in his mouth. I still throw them for him, as he still brings the half covered (or naked) mice to me to throw. So far, he has not chewed the bodies apart. Original review below, I lowered my rating from 5 stars to 3, he still loves them, so three stars for that, technically they should have one for durability.George, who like most kitties has a mind of his own about what he will like or dislike, loves these little guys. They are relatively heavy, so they have a good feel for carrying around, they also bounce nicely when tossed, and since George fetches, this makes tossing them for him even more exciting for him to chase. The price is fantastic, I consider them throw away toys, when he's destroyed all of them, we'll just buy more. BUY THESE!!",Updated review: 2 claws up!! limited durability,3

935,"""Frank Forrest \""Quasar\""""","""If you've read some of the reviews about this product, you probably came away a bit confused. I know I was. There were reviews that said it was cheap and didn't work to other comments that said it was a great product. So which ones were true, I thought. Only one way to find out; I purchased one. Here is what I found out.This review is for the 20-inch LED hood and are specific to this hood size.Bright lights--------------As far as adequate lighting, there is more than enough to fill up a 10-gallon tank. I don't know why others have complained about the lack of lighting. I found it quite bright when compared to my old incandescent lights, and the slight falloff of brightness in the corners is just nitpicking, in my opinion. It is barely perceptible.Plants like it---------------As far as being good for plants, the LED lamps are doing a fine job providing enough lighting for them to grow. None of them have died, and if anything, appear to be as healthy or better than with incandescent lighting.Cheap or not?-------------Some reviews said the hood was cheaply made. On this point,this all depends on what you consider cheap. The hood itself is well made, but it isn't of the thickest plastic that I usually expect in aquarium hoods. The fit was just right, but the hood did not fit flush on top of the fish tank. I did a little adjustment with the clips that attached the light to the hood and it straightened out nicely.Filter panels--------------The opening on the back of the hood, for hang on the back filters, measures about 6 and 7/8s inches. There was enough room for my filter plus a little space left over to place my aquarium heater next to it. For filters that are wider, you will need to cut or saw the plastic to make the openings wider for your use.If you've got an air stone at the back of the aquarium like I do, you'll see a significant amount of water splash onto the back of the hood. This didn't look too good for the light switch so all I did was to cut a piece of filter foam to cover the exposed hood area area. Problem solved. You can also cut a piece of stiff clear plastic from a package to do this as well.If you've got a water filter that splashes water upon its reentry into the aquarium, a similar solution will also fix this.LED protection---------------There is a little plastic shield that covers the LED light, and I found that this completely shields the LED lights from any water that splashes onto this area. The light was securely snapped into place, and when the hood is opened, it does not fall out as others have indicated. But it will fall out if the hood is opened at a 90-degree angle.The hood can be propped up with a small spoon or fork if you need to clean or vacuum the tank, and it's really no big deal to lift the hood to feed your fish. It only takes a micro-calorie to do this. There is a little slide out door that you can remove to leave a little opening to feed your fish, but I have left it on to make the hood look more uniform.Clean and healthy design-------------------------The main reason why I purchased this hood was because of two reasons. I suspected that my old incandescent hood was slowly leeching bad metals into the water because the metal parts were rusting from the moisture, and the excessive algae growing underneath the hood was really unsightly. The LED hood is free of metal parts, and it is healthier for my tropical fish. I also like the low profile design of the hood. It makes the tank look sleeker.Easy assembly; read the directions-----------------------------------Setting up the hood on my fish tank took about a half an hour because I wanted to make sure I understood the directions on how to attach the hood clips at the back of the tank. You actually have to angle the clips down at a 45-degree angle and then lift up so the other side of the clip can attach underneath the aquarium frame. There are two sizes of clips so make sure you use the right ones.Once this is done, you have to apply pressure to the joints of the hood, on top of the clips, in order for the two to snap together. No a whole lot of force is needed, but you do have to angle your push so that it is directed exactly downward on the clips. The instructions saved me a lot of hassle, so you may want to read them carefully.LED Performance----------------Switching over to LED from incandescent was a bit of a shock as the light spectrum of LEDs is definitely on the bluer side as opposed to incandescent bulbs which are more yellow. This lighting really makes everything pop in the fish tank, but since it is a bit weak on the red spectrum, reds and yellows don't come out as much. The blue moonlight feature is an extra bonus and I've watched my fish during the night under this lighting. They seem to like it, although I haven't left it on all night yet.After about a week of getting used to the LED lights, I prefer these over my old lights. Family members are envious of how the tank looks in comparison with their regular light bulb setups. They've noticed that the tank now looks very sharp and \""professional,\"" whatever that means, lol.You may not like the bluish-green tint of these lights, so take this into consideration if you are thinking about buying this unit.Conclusion-----------This hood is a great bargain, and only time will tell if it is long lasting as well. But for what I paid for it, which is essentially the same price I would have had to pay for a similar incandescent set up with those horrific rusting metal parts, I would say that this LED hood is well worth it for the health of my fish and the overall look of the tank. Plus it uses less energy and puts out virtually no heat--a plus when the weather gets hot.This hood isn't perfect, but for what it does, it definitely is a good aquarium hood. This hood works for me, but YMMV. Just understand that this is a bargain hood, and don't expect $100 features from it. If you've got that down, you should be OK with it.""",A review that may answer some questions,4
936,Annie,"my 4-wk old kitten mastered it in 3 sessions and now we have a blast playing with it. He jams both paws into the openings or sticks one in to whack the ball and sometimes bounces it back and forth against the end zone. We play cooperatively for 15 minutes or more. He only has 3 legs so it is amazing to watch him balance on two to hit the ball with the third.My older cats have just ignored the ball. I actually put treats inside and they enjoy digging them out, so it isn't wasted on them either. It is high quality, very clever in the way it keeps the ball rolling.

965,Amber,"I wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I ordered our first Lectro-Soft heated outdoor pet bed.  I certainly wasn't expecting a sort of air matress with a dinky, piddly little fleece cover.  I expected both to get torn up pretty quickly, being outdoors and exposed to cats with razor sharp claws.  And even after having it plugged in for a while inside, it just didn't feel like it was getting warm to me.  I figured it would end up just being a waste of money, but then that wasn't really for me to decide.The feral cats that we care for seemed to like the first one well enough that we ordered a second.  Both sit inside of clear plastic storage totes that serve as shelters, and when the weather gets cold, it's not uncommon to look inside and see a cat curled up, sound asleep, and perfectly content on their toasty little air matress.  Granted it never gets especially cold around here, but if the beds weren't warm and comfy, the cats wouldn't bother with them.  We actually have several different types of shelters available to our ferals (and any other cats that find themselves stuck outside in bad weather), and these are the ones they prefer.  We've used these things through 2 winters so far, and to my surprise, the covers and beds both have held up just fine.

I definitely agree with other reviewers that the directions the company sent were crap - very difficult to decipher but my husband and I figured it out in about an hour and a half. The cage was missing two screws and I emailed the company about it - they sent me replacements immediately (and actually sent me the entire set of screws so now I have tons of extras).Because other reviewers said the wire mesh flooring can be problematic for little chinchilla feet I put cardboard down and then put bedding down on the bottom floor and have a few marble slabs on the top one.

968,Lazychick,"""I have 2 senior cats (1 male; 1 female) and am the previous owner of the Litter Locker I. Technically, I still own the previous one, but wanted to give this a go since the Litter Locker wasn't as convenient as I might have liked. So far I do like this unit and will probably continue to use it; however, there are some things that I don't like about it and hope the company might improve.PROSFor starters, I do like the shape, color (grey) and overall look of the unit, especially when my Litter Locker was stark-white with blue (meh) and was a bit of an obvious eye sore in my dinky bathroom area. I also appreciate the sliding bit to let the the clumps fall down when compared to the Litter Locker one, which you had to turn a wheel to get things to go down. I like the handle in the back of the Genie, especially since I have to place it on top of my litter box (hooded Catit and previously the Omega Paw). The price is fantastic and affordable, even for my significantly tight budget. The bags seem thicker than the Litter Locker, so I worry less about the bag break (never had that problem with the other bags, but they were on the thin side). I also like how I'm not bowled over by a stench when I go to cute the bag, which is also pretty easy to do (though leave enough bag to tie the waste portion off). Above all, it is odor-free and works. Changing the bag is also seems easier than on the LLI, since I don't have to wrap it around a dumb wheel ha.CONSWhile I do like the Genie and the fact that it's compact, I kind of wish it were a bit bigger--both width-wise and when it comes to height. It's short stature means that it won't contain as much waste as other units, and if you have 2 or more cats, this will likely mean you have to empty it a little more often. Some people may prefer this if they don't want to carry a heavier bag out though. Secondly, the slider part that drops the waste isn't very efficient. I'm a pretty tall/big chick and strong, but this pullout thing's a bit stiff and hard to pull out to allow the waste to drop down. It's not impossible to move, of course, but I often find that I have to shake or tap it on the floor just to get it do so. It seems to get caught on the bag because of the setup (though I may need to just tweak it a bit more). I also wish the hole at the top, where you drop the waste into, were a bit bigger. In fact, this is my biggest issue with the unit. If your cat pees in large clumps, you're going to have to break up the urine clump to get it in the hole. This is an issue I have with my 12lb. male, especially now that he's older, and regardless of what litter I use (it also made emptying the Omega Paw an issue later tut). Even with decent-sized clumps, it's still going to make a mess, especially with having to contend with the fact that the pullout thing doesn't work as well as it should.Lastly, I think its level of convenience will depend on how often you empty your litter, obviously, which will also depend on your pets. I usually only have to do it once a day, though sometimes twice. Right now, because my Catit hooded litter box (defo recommend it) works so well and is large, I can easily go all day without it filling up or getting smelly. However, if you have more than one pet and do it once a day, or even a little less often, you will also have to deal with the space between the hole and the slide-y thing--there's not a lot of room. Because of male-sized treasures and the rest, I do have to pull the thing out to let it drop down fairly often in one sifting. It's not a deal-breaker, but thought I'd mention this as well. It would be grand if this portion of it were taller too.All in all, I do like the unit and perhaps it just needs a little more use to break it in. I cannot say how it would compare to the Litter Locker II in convenience, though they seem very similar. My mother has the Litter Champ, which I've not seen yet, but will update if I get to make a comparison. However, with this one, while I do like it, I kind of would appreciate it more if I didn't have to do \""tricks\"" to avoid an unnecessary mess (i.e. a bigger hole up top and efficient pullout tab), which only slows down the dreaded task more than it probably should. Still, it works and is odor-free, it's inexpensive, and it does keep me from having to make multiple trips every time I empty the litter, or having to see a bag on the porch until one of us can walk it to the dumpster. It's also a tad faster to work with than the LLI, though I did find the LLI was not so hard to get clumps into, so I may hold onto it just in case doh. I do, however, feel this would be ideal for single cats (especially females or ones who don't urinate in the same spot or much at one time), kittens, frequent emptiers, and those who need something that's compact. If, for whatever reason, you have a lot of cats or go more than a day or two without emptying, then you may want something a bit bigger (IMO).""",Pretty Decent,4

971,Robin Friedman,"""Cats and their people enjoy change and variety. For example, in reviewing here on Amazon, I have expanded from books and music to an occasional review of products for my little cat. The cat and I both like change and variety in exploring new foods. And so, our interests came together in trying this new adult dry food product for indoor cats from Ideal Balance. In addition to the fun of something new, my cat stays indoors and needs to lose weight, making this product appropriate for her.Cats are honest and infallible judges of their likes and dislikes, unlike their humans; and my kitty responded with great enthusiasm to this new food.  She eats it quickly and with gusto whenever I put it out.  I have used it as her main meal for the day, as a supplement to wet food, and even as a treat. She received it happily each time. I often feed her a wet cat food mixture of chicken and turkey, a combination she obviously views with aplomb.The product is made with fresh chicken as the primary ingredient to help cats lose weight. It also includes real turkey as opposed to by-products.  This is not a \""grain free\"" food, but it includes barley, which the manufacturer claims promotes good digestion, as opposed to the more common and harder to digest corn, wheat or soy.  The food includes as well fish oil, oats, and apples and broccoli.  The manufacture says this food includes exclusively natural ingredients including protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber ideally balanced to promote the cat's health requirements -- neither too little nor too much. The product comes in a heavy Velcro bag which is easy to open and allows for sealing and storage. The price is on the high side, but the product quality makes it worth the money.Ideal Balance is made by the manufacturer of Hills Science Diet, a company I have come to trust for feeding the cat. Before trying this product, I had been feeding kitty a different variety of Ideal Balance for the dry food portion of her diet. Trying something new is valuable. My cat enjoys this product thoroughly, it appears, and it is good for her. I will continue to use it as an appealing dry food choice for my kitty.Robin Friedman""",A New Indoor Cat Food from Ideal Balance,5

She is not finicky and likes most things even carrots so that is a pretty strong commentary by her on the taste of this calming aid by NoviPet.  She did eat it and it did seem to help with her jumpiness.  Sometimes she gets jumpy and easily startled, not all the time, but sometimes, and I am not sure why.  She is pretty spoiled including trips to the chiropractor when I think something is not perfectly right with her musculoskeletal system.  Sometimes when she is napping and I touch her she sleeps right through it or wakes up and gives me a lick while other times she is startled and jumps a foot off the ground.  Maybe it has to do with what she is dreaming good or bad but then again I have seen her jump startled when she is wide awake and there is an unexpected noise.

Where to begin.First, with an 80 pound Giant Schnauzer in the back seat, I have always used a dog safety harness of one kind or another.Even though I am not an engineer, many of these so-called safety harnesses would make you wonder whether they did the job or not, or if plastic buckles would let go, whether or not centrifical force would still shove/pull the dog forward and break the harness or choke the dog, decapitate you,  etc., etc.But operating on the philosophy that something is better than nothing, and hopefully ethics would guide the harness manufacturer into being honest about the harnesses capability, I always strapped our dog in.But I never really knew whether or not  the harnesses would work as  advertised, until I found the video through Google.  The test was done with a dog using the harness I was currently using on our dog, and it failed the test!  The dog shot forward.Now, if I were in a real accident,  and the dog had that harness on, either the dog would break his own neck, or HE WOULD BREAK MY neck.On the Clickit Utility harness, staps with metal hooks attached to each side of the harness, and  tether the dog harness to the rear-baby-seat anchors, down at the seat/back level,These metal attachments are NOT simple &#34;D&#34; rings, which might come open if enough force is applied.Once I got the  tether straps hooked onto the baby-seat tethers in the back seat, I decided to leave them there, and just unhook the dog at the harness level when releasing him to get out of the car.There is a tether strap on EACH  side of the harness, so in an accident the straps apply equal pressure on either side of the harness, maintaining the fit of the harness on the dog, and keeping the dog DOWN on the seat, and  in place against the BACK of the seat.Then, when the seat belt is pulled through the attachment on the back of the harness,  the end result appears to be the dog is NOT ONLY held DOWN by the straps attached on either side of harness going to baby-seat tethers -- BUT  the dog is also held BACK  on the seat  by using the car seat-belt system.The fabric/belting material used in the harness itself and in the tethering straps, appears to be identical to the strap material used in our Subaru seat-belts on the car itself.This harness is worth the money; and it is worth using -- because if I  don't use it and I am in an accident  -- it is MY NECK, or the DOG's -- or maybe both.",A Serious Restraint Harness for Your Pet,5

However, now that we've been supplementing their regular diet with handfuls of Nutrience Ocean Fish dogfood given as treats, I have noticed a particularly disturbing change in one of my two dogs. My Brittany is not given to stomach sensitivities like the Cocker Spaniel. But, ever since they have both received about a half a cup a day of the new food, the Brittany has started periodically and very violently vomiting. Once a day, for about twenty minutes, she throws up with horrible noises, so powerfully that she can barely stand afterward. Then after an hour she seems fine and has no other symptoms. It has been 10 days since we got the food. I discontinued feeding it two days ago and no more vomiting. Not sure if I will reintroduce it to see if the symptoms return, but there are some serious sounding warnings about the yeast ingredient in the food and what it can do to a dog sounds exactly like what we're experiencing. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with the food, because the other dog has no problems at all and still gobbles it like candy, but it is possible that the Brit just can't digest it. There has been no diarrhea or any sign of other illness.Tried the stuff again four weeks later with same vomiting results. It's going in the garbage.Here's the original review:The initial problem with Nutrience Ocean Fish dog food is that with this I cannot leave food in the bowl - the dogs will eat every crumb they see rather than free grazing. Perhaps over time they would become accustomed to it and be able to leave when they are full rather than gorging themselves. Seriously stinky with fish, my two cannot get enough of it.In a more practical vein, this dog food is newly introduced in the US, although in my search online apparently it has been widely distributed in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. I found this review of its nutritional values: [...] which gives it great praise for the substance and most ingredients.

This is better for her current food as I can make the hole small enough to distribute the kibble slowly. You can't put big food into it as the hole is too small. The hole is adjustable lengthwise (think of those long balloons), but is only 1/2 inch wide, so kibble or treats that are round and bigger than 1/2 inch will not work in this.My complaint is the claim that this is 5 inches.  Now, without the obvious jokes, I don't know what man is trying to convince us that this is 5 inches.  I measured it twice and come to about 4.25 inches.  It is actually fine at that size, but should be labeled correctly.","Great, but not 5 inches",5

1014,V. Canfield,"My huge dogs are not particularly picky, so they gave Iams Grain Free Chicken a sniff and ate the food without any problems. Now the first ingredient is chicken, not chicken by-product or chicken meal, so that's the most imprortant part. You can get a complete analysis of the kibble on dogfoodadvisor dot com. But I'll list the ingredients and a quick analysis below it.Ingredients: Chicken, peas, pea starch, chicken meal, menhaden meal, beet pulp, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), dried egg product, natural flavors, flaxseed, potassium chloride, salt, monosodium phosphate, carrots, tomatoes, choline chloride, spinach, blueberries, vitamins (ascorbic acid, vitamin A acetate, calcium pantothenate, biotin, thiamine mononitrate (source of vitamin B1), vitamin B12 supplement, niacin, riboflavin supplement (source of vitamin B2), inositol, pyridoxine hydrochloride (source of vitamin B6), vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid), minerals (ferrous sulfate, zinc oxide, manganese sulfate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, potassium iodide, cobalt carbonate), dl-methionine, apple pomace, calcium carbonate, rosemary extractJudging by its ingredients alone, Iams Grain Free Naturals looks like an above-average dry dog food. Bu according to dogfoodadvisor you can't go by ingredient quality by itself. What they generally look for is meat content, not protein content. Their dashboard displays a dry matter protein reading of 27%, a fat level of 13% and estimated carbohydrates of about 52%. And a fat-to-protein ratio of about 50%.Near-average protein. Below-average fat. And above-average carbs when compared to a typical dry dog food.But you have to account for the protein that is added by the peas and flaxseed. This makes Iams Grain Free Chicken a kibble with below-average amount of meat.Dogfood advisor's bottom line--Iams Grain Free Naturals is a plant-based dry dog food using a moderate amount of chicken and chicken meal as its main sources of animal protein, thus earning the brand 3.5 stars.But this food is alot better than your usual brand, including junk-food kibble such as Kibble and Bits, Purina Dog Chow or Ol' Roy.",Good Quality Kibble,4

1031,Summer H,"I am fairly new to aquariums, but recently bought some fish with ich and had to treat my tank.  The store gave us some, but not enough for a full 3 week treatment needed for Ich (that is how long the life cycle is).  We discovered the ich about 12 hours after the fish were introduced to the tank and started Para Guard that day.  We have about 40 fry in our tank as well, so I had to be cautious that whatever we put in the tank would protect them and not injure them.  Within just 3 days the Ich spots were almost completely gone from our affected fish.  None of my other fish developed Ich.Just a little advice for anyone looking to use this, you CANNOT have carbon in your filter at the time because it will absorb the medicine.  When you are finished with the medication, then add carbon to help absorb it.  I was advised to do a 40-50% water change at the end of our medication cycle.Also, if you have sensitive skin or allergies, be cautious putting your hand in the water with this in.  I have sensitive skin and a lot of allergies and during a routine water change I reached in my 24 inch deep tank to pull our rocks to clean up.  Within about 10 minutes my whole arm was broken out, red, itching, etc.  I showered immediately and took some anti-histamine medicine.

The first few times I did it, water got everywhere, because there's a dispensing spout on the bottom that sprays water if you don't get the jug in place exactly right.  I've kind of got the hang of it now, but it's still a chore I hate doing (and one I'll only do if I'm about to change my clothes anyway!)  ;-)What I really don't understand is why the top of the water station unscrews -- it makes it seem as though you can conveniently fill it from the top (while it sits in its stand) -- but you can't.  The black top cap just unscrews for no apparent reason...!?  I think this is an odd design point.That being said, my dog LOVES drinking out of this thing, and will pick it every time over an ordinary dish.  The (optional) filter I have in it obviously does improve the taste of the water, even to a dog!  But I would not recommend this product due to the difficulty I've had filling it.

1046,Lisa B.,"It took some time for our medium-sized dog to get used to the Nylabone Wishbone, the first nylabone product we tried, as it is much harder than the rawhide he loves so much. However, once he took a liking to it, it lasted less than a month. For some reason, he would only chew one of the prongs and not touch the other two even when a good chunk of the first prong was gone. I felt that I always needed to supervise him when he chewed this toy because it was easy for him to bite off sharp pieces. I also never left it on the floor, pulling it out from his toy box only when I was there to watch him. This product definitely satisfied our dog's urge to chew and it was enough to replace rawhide, which is much more expensive. Although we didn't stick with this product, it led us to the Nylabone Big Chew Beef Bone, a much larger bone that so far has lasted for 3 months. It has enough thickness to prevent our dog from sharpening it like a knife, which he used to do with the Wishbone. And I don't have to worry about him swallowing sharp pieces while I am not there to watch.Overall, the Wishbone can be a suitable chew for smaller, less aggressive chewers.

My cats lost interest in the speed circuit because they were not hitting it hard enough to get it over the arches.  This way they can play and not lose interest and not get frustrated.  Also, the slots on the speed circuit for the cats to put their paw thru are not very ergonomically correct, if you will.

1070,Omar Siddique,"I got this scratcher for my older kittens (who are just shy of 1 year), they prefer scratching non-horizontal surfaces, and that usually has meant the furniture rather than the flat cardboard scratchers I've tried to lean against the walls.Both kittens were initially fascinated with this scratcher, and went after it with gusto, but got bored with it after about a week.  I could probably rekindle their interest by adding fresh catnip to the surface.During the week, the scratcher moved around a lot, often ending on its side, as the kittens played with it and played through the openings in its sides.  The smaller kitten could fit her head into the opening.  Considering this is normal cat behavior, the scratcher should be a little heavier to keep it from falling over so easily.The kittens loved the toy inside the opening especially, which was a paper poof on a string, and dragged the scratcher around by the string.  But the toy tore loose within 3 days.Overall, a very good design and a decent value.

With this harness, I barely feel a tug before our dog corrects herself.  The key is having the D-ring in the front, rather than the top of the harness.  As your dog pulls ahead, her chest is redirected back towards you.I would give this harness five stars if not for the fit issues.  I've tried different sizes, and the M/L is the closest fit I could get for my dog.  Even so, the strap that goes under the dog's body is too short, while the top and front straps have plenty of extra (adjustable) length... So the chest strap is kind of low on the dog's body.  It still works, but seems a bit uncomfortable.Another small gripe is that after a few walks, all the straps need to be tightened up again.

We'd purchased the plain Nylabone ring, but he chewed it up so quickly that it became razor sharp in just a few days and we had to throw it out. This was our last hope.Thank goodness it has worked! He chews this ring every single night at bedtime (he won't go to sleep until he has chewed for a good 20 minutes, we call it his \""binky\"", it's adorable) and has had it for six months, now. Finally, after six months one side is JUST beginning to become a tiny bit sharp and we are thinking of ordering a new one. We are so impressed with the quality and durability of this chew. Nothing else we tried lasted this long.Another plus? It keeps his teeth super clean. Our vet is always impressed at how clean his mouth is, and I think his nightly Nylabone chewing marathons are mostly responsible for this.Lastly, the ring design is great for our dog because he puts one paw through it to hold it still while he chews.

1089,"""Judy Smith \""judylynnsbooks\""""","I can see where some people might like this versus pee pads but I'm not one of them. First of all the plastic grass smells like plastic and my girls just turned their nose up at it. I could not get them to step up on the mat at all so finally took the grass off and held one over it until she did her job thinking the smell would get them back to it again. So for days I left the grass on a pee pad to ease them into the transition. Finally I thought they were ready for it to go back on the tray, so back it goes. They refuse to jump on the tray (maybe because it wobbles a little and that might scare them). So I took the whole thing up since I didn't want to have to clean the grass for nothing when before all I had to do was throw out the pee pad. Pee pads do add up in cost but this plastic contraption is quite expensive for what it is....all plastic...too and I had much rather throw out a pad then take this thing outside every day and wash down. My babies loved their stroller and loved their car seats I got them, but I'm afraid they are never going to love this. If you have the patience and want to save money, then the price here is better than buying pee pads for years (I spend about a $150 a year on those.) I would say this grass mat would last forever unless it eventually starts smelling but they may sell replacements.

Honestly, the only positive comment I can make is the pleasant neutral colors of the box. The box is practically impossible to scoop out of. Why would I try to scoop a litter box that is \""self-cleaning\"" you ask, because it DOESN'T work! The lid attatchments are not user friendly to latch and unlatch. Make sure you get them on exactly correct before you try to roll the box over! We use Tidy Cats scoopable litter and the mechanics of rolling the box on its' lid made for a mess (even when done slowly). Clumps stuck to the box or broke apart and crumbles were mixed in with what was left of the \""clean\"" litter. Even with slowly turning the box over I felt like too much \""clean\"" litter went into the catch drawer which is dumped. Our cats tend to like to scratch an almost clear area of the box to void and that doesn't release from the box surface during roll-overs. The lack of swinging door and lack of charcoal filters made a marked increase in odor eminating from the box. We place 2 of our boxes in the laundry room and the third in a corner behind a recliner chair. The size of the box was very cumbersome to manipulate (try to roll over, scoop, or get the lid off) especially in the corner. The box takes up so much more room to try to do these things than our old boxes which the lids easily and fully detatch. The boxes are about the same size, it's just that this self cleaning one takes up a lot of space when you are rolling it back and forth. There is no handle on the top of this box to help you grab it in order to move it to an area where you have the space to work it and access it. A large portion of the surface area (floor) of the litter box is taken up by the \""clean\"" litter receptacle space, so despite the box's size, it really doesn't offer that much space for your cat to use it. Once you have finished \""cleaning\"" the box then you have to tip it backward to get the litter out of the receptacle area. I found it difficult to get the litter evenly distributed on the floor of the box. You need to shake the box, roll it forward and backward and side to side. All in all I returned the box after trying it for about a week. It took a lot more effort to use than the old style we had, it made for more work, and made more of a mess (and odor) to manage.

New tanks cycle much faster with Seachem's Prime, water changes are much easier on my finned friends with Stressguard and I have a wonderfully functioning bio system using Seachem's Stability.I use the Seachem line exclusively for the care of my planted tanks and have had great results. I am new to live planted aquariums and I credit Seachem's products with keeping my plants healthy, lush and growing beautifully.The Seachem products are far better than most of the aquarium products offered in most pet stores and are well worth the money. You use less and get far better results. My fish are happy and that makes me happy!I have gotten rid of numerous other products and cut down on the number of products needed by switching to the Seachem line. I make sure I am stocked ahead with Prime, Stressguard, Stability and their fertilizers. In addition to the fact their products actually work, they have wonderful customer service and promptly answer questions. All in all, I trust Seachem above other brands to keep my fish healthy and happy and my planted aquariums beautiful. Great products - must haves.""",I trust Seachem,5

1134,"""M. Johnson \""Tea Lover\""""","After doing a ton of research on doggy trailers, i got this one. I'm so glad! This dog trailer is extremely well built, sturdy and gives an ultra smooth ride. I can't even feel any difference when it's on my bike the the dogs are in it, it rolls so smoothly. There is a spring on the part that connects it to the bike so it can move easily, even with sharp turns. Super easy to tow. It holds both my Maltese dogs easily, one is 16 pounds, the other is 6 pounds. (See my photos).I set it up myself with in about 20 minutes.  The only tool you need is a socket wrench or crescent wrench to attach the tow hitch to the bike wheel. Since I live on the second floor of an apartment,  I have to carry it down stairs to get outside, but that was not a problem since its pretty light.One tip about he pneumatic tires. Don't try to measure the air pressure with a gauge, just go by how hard the tire feels when you pump it up. This is because, when I was testing the tire pressure, the amount if air that would come out when I put on the pressure gauge on was enough to let out 10 psi of pressure, so the tire would get soft. I though there was a leak in the tire at first, but after removing the tube and checking, no leak was found. That is when I realized the problem was with testing the air pressure. If you can fill it with one of those pumps that has the built in pressure gauge that would work great. Or just pump up the tire until it feels nice and hard. ( like we used to do in the good old days with out bike tires).I also highly recommend either buying the foam pad to put in, or put in your own pad or folded blanket or even a little dog bed to add comfort and security for the dogs. It has a clasp inside so you can snap it to your dogs collar or harness to keep him from jumping out, but I ended up taking it off because my dog is not trying to jump out at all. They both love it. I think for the first few rides its a good idea to stope every 15 minutes or so, to let the dog out to potty and have a short break until they are fully acclimated to the experience.Also, the instructions recommend teaching the dog to enter and exit thought the back, instead of the top, which is a good idea to help prevent the dog from thinking  to jump out the top as you ride. There is a zipper flap that closes the top though, so you can always just keep it zipped if you worry about the dog jumping out. The front has a flap you can zip closed too, if it's cold out, or you can roll it up and there is a screen so the dog can have a nice breeze.I am so extremely happy with this doggy ride mini. I give it a 100%positive review and highly recommend it. You will be so happy if you get one, and so will your dogs! Ok, we're gonna go out for another ride  now, see ya later!",Excellent for carrying one or two small dogs,5

It is hemmed well (some animal sweaters that I have ordered are not) and seems very warm and soft. I ordered a small for my hairless cat - he gets cold easily so he likes wearing sweaters. This is a bit too big for him and I had to pin the hood back so it stays out of his face, but he's only 6 pounds so that's not really the seller's fault.

1136,Ellie,"I caught 2 fleas with this thing.I really didn't want to use chemicals in my home, but ultimately a combination of flea medication and fogging is what finally killed the little jumpers.After a month of just leaving the trap on (and still fighting the fleas) one of my cats tails went into the trap and got stuck to the sticky paper.  This resulted in a freaked out cat running from one end of the house to the other with the entire lamp and cord trailing behind it.  The hilarity of the situation quickly subsided when my cat jumped onto a bookcase to escape the evil contraption and knocked over some of my nicer display things.  The trap did not survive the incident and the cat is now leery of cables.I'm glad this product has worked for other but I expected it to catch more than 2 fleas and definitely did not expect it to catch a cat (once the cat was rid of her fleas of course).

Before noon this morning, one of the legs had been severed. We got it before she got to the plastic squeaker. I cut the leg off up to the next knot. It is not rope inside but layers of material.

1139,Patricia Gray,"I've been using Drinkwell for around 5 years now and I have always loved their products. The cats really enjoy the waterfall from their old Drinkwell and it encourages them to drink more. This product also features the waterfall the kitties love and they do love the product as much as I do.My only complaint with this is that the top level needs to have a water level that is within 1/4 - 1/2 inch from the top lip. Any little bump from me or while the cats are playing (read: fighting) near the fountain results in a spill. We keep a towel and a placemat under this to allow for easy clean up or to catch little spills.The noise is not an issue with me as I have seen other reviewers that talk about this issue, but I tend to top the water off daily, so it's not too bad an issue with me. Anytime there is a motor involved in anything it will make noise, but it is no louder than the older Drinkwell products we have had in the past. Kitties love it and we love it.

1144,JO,"""Zhaba has a sensitive stomach and a propensity to developing yeasty ear infections and skin lesions.  Whereas some dogs have \""iron stomachs\"" which tolerate anything including sticks and bones, hers does not.  We've tried several dog foods for her and this one has worked the best.  She tolerates it well and her poops are very predictable, arriving regularly and without stress or strain.  For her, it's better than other more trendy foods which include limited ingredient products.  Her skin has also greatly improved to being great with this food and her ears have shown no signs of yeast for months!I've been purchasing smaller bags locally but ordered this large bag which I will repackage into smaller vacuum sealed bags after opening it next week.  TheHill's Science Diet Adult Sensitive Stomach Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bagis heavy and will last us for months since she's a small dog, but it's worth a little effort for me to save a substantial amount instead of replenishing the 4.5 pound bags.  I've saved a couple of those empty bags because I like the velcro closure, and will use one to transfer a vacuum sealed bag at a time.I've purchased smaller bites of food and found that Zhaba inhaled those without chewing.  These are about the same size as the regular adult Science Diet food that came home with her when I adopted her last November.  Because she has a tendency to play with her food before eating it, rewarding herself with every bite as she heartily crunches down.  As with any food, she sometimes ignores a meal, but I find that at the end of the day, she usually consumes the little over a cup daily that she needs.  Her digestion is smooth now, she's healthy, and she enjoys her meals.EDIT:  Just opened the bag and the nibble is larger. Ingredients are the same,  the picture of size on the bag is the same. I called Hills and learned that this is a new formula and this is the new size.  My dog isn't happy but she'll learn.

1157,Peter Suslock,"API is a giant among companies that provide aquarium related products.They have maintained their sound reputation by offering innovative products and resisting the temptation to tamper with those which are already established and are time proven, dependable performers.The Fresh Water Master Test Kit belongs in the arsenal of tank maintenance and care products for every level of hobbyist from beginner to advanced.It's important to understand that these kits provide an indication only - it's unrealistic to expect a pin point reading as the tests aren't intended nor made to deliver that. But rather, to enable you to get a decent reading of say, where your PH level is knowing the accuracy may be off a few points sure beats shelling out $200 for a good digital PH meter.It's critical to understand these limitations and that they apply to everyone of the four included tests.PHHigh Range PHAmmoniaNitritesNitratesFor must of us, Ammonia is the most important because it's the number one killer of aquarium kept fish. The others are important of course, but Ammonia levels should always be checked and checked often. It's also important to pay attention to the expiration dates of the liquid reagents. Expired reagents mean off the charts inaccurate readings. Along with the liquid reagents the kit includes, instructions both in a small manual and attached to each bottle of testing liquid, four test tube, four plastic caps and a color chart.To ensure you get the most accurate reading possible compare the finished result to the card color block in the best possible light and against the most pure white background you can find. Just like computer monitors many of us see color differently which is the inherent draw back of this type of testing. But again, there is nothing else on the market at this kind of price point which can give you enough information to correct and adjust your key water parameters.If you're just starting out in this wonderful hobby, you'll master using this kit in no time and it will help you maintain a healthy and flourishing aquarium. Remember to never, ever rinse even cleaned test tubes in your tank water - even very small traces of testing reagents can be lethal to your fish.Draw water from your tank using a large plastic syringe available at any drug store, super market, or add one to cart from Amazon.For a full range of tests that cover the four most significant parameters you need to stay on top of - you can't beat the API Master test kits, not at this price. You can also buy replacement API test tubes which are sold in boxes of a dozen or 24 at a reasonable price, and a steal at Amazon.",A Must Have Test Kit For Every Level Of Hobbyist,5

I was looking for our regular Eukanuba brand. This fancy place only had some pricey food, including Royal Canin, which I was not familiar with. I bought it anyway since I had never seen food especially for the Maine Coon breed. Well, our cat Vita loved it. She can't just scarf this food down and then throw up like she does with other food! She eats it properly and, amazingly, does not leave food in the dish. Her favorite trick is to always leave food behind and then complain that it's stale. For instance, with the Paul Newman food, she eats a few bites and then walks away. Then she comes back and camps out by her dish waiting for a few more \""fresh\"" morsels. When I give her Iams, she gobbles her food like a little demon. Then I go to work or do some chores and voila, I find a pile of thrown-up kibble on the carpet. Of course, I try giving her small doses of kibble... boy, does this cat eat a lot. She is very healthy though and not too fat. The main point of my review is: so far Royal Canin Maine Coon 31 Formula is proving to be the right food for this big girl.Other important points: The price through Amazon is much better than through the pet store. The convenience of finding it online versus not knowing where the heck it might be stocked is wonderful. The most surprising thing was shipping was super fast. I ordered on Saturday night and got it Monday afternoon. How did they do that? I've never experienced such fast FREE shipping with Amazon. Also, I paid no extra sales tax.

1184,M.G.,Before I purchase any kind of food I make sure to read the instructions as well as reviews. I did as recommended and I fed my dog part canned rabbit food and part dry dog food. Well it made my poor dog sick. She hadn't been sick of her stomach like that in many years and it scared me. I'm sure it was the rabbit food that gave her diarrhea. She only ate it once and that was enough for her to get sick and for me to throw it out. I had to nurse her back to health with chicken broth and rice and thank heavens it didn't take long for her to get better. However my cats ate the turkey mixed in with their dry cat food and they were fine. Still I didn't feed it to them again and never will.  I won't be purchasing this stuff again.

1185,"""Pamela V \""&#34;MS V&#34;\""""","The Litter Genie is compared to a Diaper Genie for human baby diaper disposal, but you are supposed to flush the waste down the toilet and only store the soiled diaper in the Diaper Genie container.  The Litter Genie is different, because you store the soiled litter and waste particles inside the unit, until you can dispose of the wastes at a later time. It's meant to reduce odors.  Really, in my opinion, it's more about convenience than odor control, because once a cat uses the litter box, the smell is there.  You remove the waste and get rid of it, right?  You don't keep the soiled litter in the house, or at least I don't, but I live in a rural area.  The thought of keeping cat feces in a container inside our house just doesn't make sense when we live in the country.Now, if I lived in an apartment building in a city, this device would be an alternative to frequent trips to a dumpster, or of keeping closed plastic bags of waste stored until I could throw them away properly.  I can see the practicality in that scenario, however, I still find it fairly repulsive to keep cat waste in a container inside my home.I just can't get over the disgust.  I want the cat poop in the garbage, outside, where it belongs.  So basically, it's not the Litter Genies fault, but my own fault, that I can't validate this product.  And having the extra expense of buying the refills is another negative to me.For city dwellers, it's a fairly novel idea.  Doesn't work for me though.",Great for Apartment Dwellers!

It might seem expensive to some people, but that big box goes a long way, and considering this is human grade food what more can you ask for for your little guys and gals?One of my kitties adores this (he's a little pig), the other is not as keen and will only eat some if mixed with dry, but he's fussy overall. Maybe if you have a fussy cat try mixing this in with their regular stuff and increasing gradually. I think the texture and quality difference in some cases confuses cats, especially if you're jumping from cheaper brands to this one.Apparently Honest Kitchen has a recipe book which includes their dehydrated foods such as this one.You can mix with warm water or cold and just stir it up, or just stir then leave it sat for 5-10 minutes. Then serve up if your cats haven't already found a way to help themselves. Look at the box for instructions on how much to mix up but if you want to be super safe you can order the small trial size to see if your cats will take to it. I'd persevere purely because of how good quality it is. Cleans off easily as well.I wish they had more products for cats is my only complaint.

I waited too long to return it though so I will just have to buy the new part to get it going correctly, silicon isn't working well.Honestly, I find the cheaper power filters like the ones sold at wallie world do as good of a job as more expensive units like this one.

Then I added to the collection so our little friends would leave closed doors alone at night.  Our doors have enough room for little kitty paws to reach underneath and then pound the door.  This product has solved the problem.One does have to pay attention to where the motion sensor is pointed- otherwise you get lots of unwarranted sprays- but once you get the hang of it, it's simple.It doesn't hurt the cats, it doesn't leave any residue, and it's not much louder than a well-directed hiss.  There is some device out there that sets off a loud alarm: this is NOT that device.Our Christmas tree goes in a corner, so I now use 2 cans, one on each side.  The cats simply learned to walk a 3\"" or better distance from the tree instead of treating it like a challenging cat toy covered cat tree, even when the sprayers are off.The dangers are: someone, or one of your other pets sets off the spray while you're holding a cat- can result in tattered owners.Refills can be ordered in bulk for a little less than $7/can if you shop around.

I went ahead and purchased the pooch pad in a size small, my dog's waist is 14 inches but the sizing is way off and it would not fit (it was too small). I ordered the medium size and it now fits well. It is a little bulky but it does hold a lot of pee and is leak proof.

In my opinion this is more important than a review. Since the Hugh growth of 'Grain Free' dog food, people in general tend to use grain free feed as they would ordinarily use their regular dog food. They pour the food bowl full and continue to feed the dog as normal. This is not true with grain free food. Please read the directions of feeding on each specific bag. Do use the charts on quantity, depending upon your dogs size. Also important is addressed in the directions, if your dog has not had any grain free brand of food, you MUST slowly introduce a grain free food to their diet. This starts with blending a small amount of grain free food into the food bowl and use your dogs regular food to fill the bowl. After a week are so add more and after a month your dogs digestive system should be adjusted to eating grain free food, but please refer to the directions on each bag.My dog is healthier after eating grain free food. This means he is less anxious, more natural energy, happier, etc. Just some food for thought, dogs are carnivorous and not omnivorous. By nature, dogs don't eat corn, the largest filler in dog food.

Fortunately, our dog was content for a while just playing catch with it and experimenting with what would set the sound sensor off. Eventually, she nabbed it and went into a chewing session and went straight for the battery compartment. However, we did know this isn't a chew toy. The battery lasted the four weeks until he was destroyed. We all had fun going around the house listening to Mr. Bill and his &#34;oh no&#34; cries. If they made a durable version of this I'd buy in a second.",good while it lasted,5
1312,P. Ranalli,"The light itself is solid enough.  It puts out a good amount of light with a nice blue hue that looks very moonlight-esque.  The power supply provided has a nice switch on the cord for ease of controlling.  However, the product does not include a reflector and without a method of reflecting the light, the strength of the light feels a bit lackluster.  I was able to solve this easily by folding a piece of aluminum foil over it to act as a reflector, but that is not an ideal solution.  For $29.99 and what is essentially a plastic tube with some LEDs in it, I would expect to get a reflector which would likely add mere pennies to the manufacturing cost.  For that reason, and that reason alone, I give this product a 3 star rating.In order for me to give this product a 5 star rating, it would need to be priced more along the lines of $10 rather than $30.  Don't get me wrong, this light does serve its purpose and does look very nice, but it is most certainly a bit overpriced.  But this is a nuanced piece of equipment and very few others create a product specifically designed to be a moonlight for aquariums.  I suppose with the market cornered, they can get away with charging a bit more.That said, I do like the light (with my foil reflector), and I believe my fish love it as well.  It looks very nice at night not only in the water but in my room as well, as the light bounces off of the water and onto my walls.  Without a reflector, however, the light is glaringly bright sitting on top of your aquarium and a great deal of light is lost going in every direction but into the tank.I have kept the light ultimately as it is really about the only one our there, and I am happy with it.  I recommend it if you absolutely feel like you need a moonlight and don't have a fixture with one already built in.  If you are presently shopping for an overall lighting system, I would seek out one that has LEDs built in for night viewing rather than using this separate one.  It is worth it for those of us who want the nice look of the moonlight and are willing to accept that we are being gouged a bit.  Just know that for $30 you will be overpaying a bit, but you will also be getting something that wells rather well.  It's up to you to decide whether that's worth it.",Solid product but a bit pricey,3
1313,"""Kate \""shoe lover with bunion\""""","I used this spray in areas where my male cat had previously peed (it was cleaned) to discourage further use. He didn't go often just when he wasn't happy about something. Immediately after I sprayed this, he peed on those areas and he hadn't really gone there in months. So no, it didn't help for what I wanted to use it for. I will use it the cat carriers to see if that works. I use the Feliway plug ins and they work great.",Didn't help,3
1314,petlover,"I have had fairly good success with using the feliway spray on some furniture where some one had been inappropriately urinating. I of course had the furniture professionally cleaned first, this is important as spot cleaning by hand will never get out all the odor causing residue from deep in the upholstery. Even if we could not smell it, our pets have extremely sensitive noses and they can detect urine, and it will cause them to re soil the same area. So that part can not be omitted if one expects success. The feliway worked very well for me and the only reason I took one star off is because it leaves an oily residue on the fleece cover ups which I put over the chair. It didnt leave this residue on the actual upholstery fabric just on the fleece cover throws. The product has worked very well with no episodes provided it is faithfully re applied and this means every single day with no misses! I anticipate I will gradually decrease the applications but am not going to rush it this time! Of course one must first and foremost take pet for a veterinary exam. For a pet with no other way to tell you something is wrong, peeing out of the box usually gets owners attention, and my cat had serious dental pain. Perhaps the veterinary care cured the problem alone but I think the feliway plays a role also. After I applied feliway spray I found the cat lying on the floor just enjoying the scent! They say it is a settling calming spray and apparently my cat felt calmed enough to enjoy just relaxing in a room where she previously had peed on the furniture. The afore mentioned oily residue did not stain the throws it was just strange as it was only on the throws where I applied the feliway and I saw it on my hands. It washes out easily however.",comfort zone feliway spray,4

My wife would call the pet hotel daily to see how the cat was doing, and one thing the staff reported almost immediately that they noticed he wasn't drinking water.Of course! We'd forgotten that he depended on the pet fountain! So I ordered another Drinkwell and had it delivered directly to the pet hotel in his name (I asked the staff ahead of time if that was OK and they said yes). That did the trick!

1330,"""Nelly \""Vision Teacher\""""","""I already owned the \""legendary\"" Oster A5 clippers to clip my Shih Tzu's cottony, tangly coat -- the A5s were, in my opinion, very good clippers, but I thought the advantage of having a cordless pair would be tremendous, as the table I clip my dog on is not within easy reach of a power outlet, and extension cords were causing safety issues.However, I was not at ALL prepared for how much BETTER these clippers would be!  They are simply amazing.  I thought at first maybe my 3 year old A5 clippers just had a dull blade, but I even popped the old blade onto the new clippers (they're compatible with any Oster blades/combs), and they worked just as well -- clean cut through the fur, no snags or hesitation at matted areas at all.  I don't know what it is -- a more powerful motor, I guess, or maybe just a faster-moving head (?) I was very surprised by the power in these clippers, because I just assumed that going cordless would mean sacrificing some power!  The opposite was true -- these are more powerful than the A5.The clippers are unbelievably quiet, too -- they just hum along, causing very little vibration (again, compared to the A5's).  They also do not heat up to nearly the same degree that the A5s do -- those get pretty hot after a long drawn-out session.  My dog is so much calmer during a haircut with these clippers.  He's more comfortable, I think, because the clippers go through his fur like a hot knife through butter, so there's very little (if any) pulling.  I thought I already had a great pair of clippers, but these put the A5s to shame (and the A5s already put my old Andis ones to shame...)Yes, they are pricey, but if you give a lot of cuts, they are well worth it.  They are superb.  They also charge quickly, and there's a port for a second battery (not included) if you give a high volume of cuts and need continuous use.  The cordless aspect is also, of course, super convenient -- to keep the pet from getting tangled, keep your arms free, and also to give you the option to trim in any location (outside, in a basement or garage, etc) and not worry about outlets.  The operation is very quiet, smooth, and seems to give my hand way less vibration than the corded clippers, which is a big improvement.I HIGHLY recommend these clippers -- this is a well thought out, high quality set of clippers -- I can't imagine there's much to criticize here (except maybe the price!)  ;-)  But they're worth it if clipping is a big part of your life.""",Even better than the Oster A5...which I thought was impossible!,5

They love the treat inside and the small is the perfect size for my girls (both are 8 lbs).  I also stuff the back with a few pieces of kibble and a cat treat or two (they constantly try to steal the cat's treats, so when they find one in their ball, it's kind of a big deal).I agree with reviewers who say to put the treat in backwards to make it more challenging/ last longer.

1366,pippi longstocking,"Boy do our malti-poos appreciate this treat!  Smells so good that we humans sniff it every time before giving it.  I cannot vouch for its teeth-cleaning abilities yet because our malti-poos still have white, seemingly un-tartared teeth.  I can, however, vouch for its breath-cleaning abilities.  Latte, our boy malti-poo, sure had bad breath when we brought him home.  To make it worse, he was a barker and bark his breath in our faces he did.  After 3-4 treats, his bad breath went away.  Thank Greenies for allowing us to pet our Latte without turning our heads!One down side with the Teenie Greenies is that it is just that: Teenie.  Latte, at 5 pounds, was able to swallow the treat.  We are now using Greenies Large for our 8-pound Latte.  Our less food-motivated malti-poo, Mocha, was also able to finish off the treat in less than a minute at 5 pounds.  She is the most dainty of pups, too.  The guideline of the Teenie Greenies for 5 to 15 pound dogs did not work for me and may not work for every dog out there.",Too Teenie for our malti-poo pups,4
1367,"""Jennifer Smith \""~Jynn\""""","The first Frolicat BOLT I received in the mail was defective, The laser lit up but the motor would not move.  Amazon sent me a replacement in 2 days with no hassle.  My two cats really enjoy it, and will both play with it for the full duration that it is turned on.  It works better if placed on a high surface and aimed downward so that there is less chance for your cats to block the beam with their bodies, and the cat is less likely to notice where the dot is coming from (my older cat will find the toy itself and go for the dot shining out if it's set too low to the floor, and it shines right in her eyes)  I do wish it had a Variable speed control as the dot moves a little too fast for my older cat, and it would be nice if it had a timer I could set to automatically turn ON while I am away.  I have a few other automatic cat toys (the panic mouse 360 and panic mouse undercover) but this is the only one BOTH my cats will play with, and the battery life seems better so far.  I would definitely recommend this toy, and should mine break somehow, I would definitely purchase a second one.","Great toy, could use a few improvements.",4
1368,A Customer,"I recently purchased this crate for my 12 pound dog, for home and for travel purposes. The crate is lightweight, sturdy, easy to assemble and disassemble. It is attractive, and I like the convenience of the front, side and top openings. Plus the two side openings have a latch that secures the zippers to prevent doggie noses from unzipping the doors. The problem with this crate is the smell. As other reviewers have mentioned, this crate has a very strong chemical odor. I thought the smell would dissipate after a day or so, but it has not gone away and now even the foam and fleece pad I purchased to go in the bottom of the crate wreaks of chemical odor. It is very disappointing for an expensive crate like this, and it makes me wonder about how safe this is for my pet with this chemical &#34;off-gassing.&#34; I wonder what kind of chemical treatment is used to create such a strong odor? I will put the crate outside in the sun for a day or so, and hopefully that will solve the problem. I will also try and wash it. All things being equal, I would definitely choose a different crate from a different manufacturer the next time I am ready to purchase a crate. Since I need a crate for an upcoming trip, it is too late to return it and shop for another one, unfortunately. I hope this review is helpful for others who may be concerned about this issue of chemical odor and off-gassing. Chemical off-gassing is unhealthy for humans, so it is probably even worse for pets! I plan to update this review after setting it out in the sunshine and washing it.",Great crate but it does have a strong odor,2

1375,MyPenName,"""This product is a bit odd, to say the least. It is designed in a roll-on deodorant type of bottle and your dog must lick the rolling ball to enjoy his treat.When first trying to get my dog to try it, he really looked at me, looked at the bottle, looked at me, looked at the bottle etc. You could literally see in his eyes that he was wondering what the heck he was supposed to do, or what I wanted him to do. Finally he took a swipe at it with his tongue. I assume he was unimpressed because he made no effort to go for another lick, despite my encouragement.The whole idea is just weird. I give my dog treats as well..treats, or to reward good behavior, or just to be nice, or to get him to lay/settle down for a little - in other words to keep him busy for a few minutes or so. This type of treat obviously goes against the idea of keeping him occupied for awhile while keeping my time free since you have to sit/stand there and hold the bottle for him. Now, don't get me wrong, we always have a variety of snacks on hand and I would not mind standing there holding this bottle for him if he actually liked the treat. It's just one of those little extra things we do to show our love. However, he just seemed to not like the taste once he did figure out to lick it, otherwise I assume he would have continued to lick.The texture of the liquid inside just looks gross to me. It is a clearish, somewhat dark brown color. Kind of like pancake syrup although not as sticky/tacky.If your dog will lick the roller ball and likes the taste, then I guess it is a good buy, but if not it is obviously a waste.I also cannot help but wonder who sat around and thought \""Hmmmm, let's create a liquid dog treat and put it in a roll-on deodorant dispenser!!\""""",Somewhat undecided,2

I finally went to my vet, who prescribed a human joint drug off-label. That had my dog leaping around like a puppy the next day. Don't get me wrong, I realize this is entirely different from what Pet Naturals is claiming.I feel like this dog treat gives much the same result as the glucosamine-chondroitin that my husband takes every day, and has done for years-- negligible at best. Also, I think this is something best implemented BEFORE your dog has these problems. If you buy this expecting drastic results, I believe you will be disappointed. The package states that if you want to speed the results you can double their dosage for 6 weeks-- for my dog that is 5 or 6 chews a day. This gets expensive, fast, and still without visible relief for my dog.I know the side-effects associated with prescription drugs are more serious than anything that has been attributed to glucosamine or chondroitin, but my dog is old and I believe the relief he gets from his prescription medication is money better spent.

A piece of 1/8\"" foam is on each side of a vinyl heating unit.I'm surprised how large the outer cover is ~ 26\"" X 36\"" ~ that's twice the size of the 18\"" X 23 1/2\"" heating unit.So we centered the pad in the cover ~ then centered that where the cover would lay up and around ~ for more coziness.Also the pad could be turned perpendicular to use only half the covering, and would be an exact fit.The pad is plug in only ~ there isn't any switch on the cord.Pets pads for in-doors don't have wire protected cords ~and are made of a thinner plastic such as this one is.Pads for out-doors have the cord wrapped in a metal sleeve for safety.and are hard plastic ~ stiff as a board ~ not bendable.The thinking is in-door pets aren't as likely to chew on these items.Out-door animals are more prone to chewing on these items.Research was required to understand the features of this pad ~where-as it should defiantly have been included with the product.January 22, 2013 ~ I received 2 different size Oster pet pads approx 2 months ago ~both pads have been in beds made up for feral cats since the day they arrived.They're both continually used every day ~ except on occasional warmer sunny days.When I put my hand between a cat & the pad ~ at 8 degrees temp. it's toasty warm.Even though these are in-door pads I feel comfortable with them out-doors.Because the beds are sheltered from the weather, and the cats were abandoned house pets ~and I've never known them to chew on any-thing.""",Our cats are loving this pad.,5

1440,Honesty is the Best Policy,"I've tried a lot of different cat litters to see what works best. I love the smell of cedar wood, so I was really hopeful of this cedar cat litter. Unfortunately, it doesn't mask the smell of the cats' bowel movements. It also doesn't clump the urine properly, as it falls apart when scooped. There's clearly some sort of additive that tries to get the cedar to clump together, but it ends up just being this slimy, sticky goo that's not only disgusting and smelly, but DOESN'T ACTUALLY HOLD TOGETHER.What I've found does work is putting a layer of pine pellets at the bottom of the litter box then covering it with crystal litter. The crystal litter mummifies the feces so the smell is gone quickly, and it evaporates the urine so you don't even have to scoop out the disgusting urine monstrosities. The only thing is that the crystal litter does not evaporate all the urine before it soaks down to the bottom, so there's always some wetness at the bottom of the litter box. Hence the pine pellets, which soak the urine right up and masks the smell immediately. The pine litter comes as hard pellets and when a liquid touches them they soak it up and fall apart into saw dust, so you know what litter has been used and what hasn't, and you can easily tell when it needs to be changed. Using the pine litter alone is not effective at masking the feces smell though. In fact if only the pine pellets are used the feces smell is powerful. So I've found, through lots of trial and error, that the best combination is the pine pellets at the bottom and the crystal litter at the top. As far as the cedar chips go, if they came in pellets in stead of flakes I think they could be just as effective as the pine pellets, but in the flake form they're useless.","Didn't mask the smell, clumping ineffective",3

After SHE took them, she seemed to be pretty chilled out.However, the tiny little bundle of speed didn't blink an eye. Since she had some digestive upset (not sure it was the pills, she is a DOG after all, and we never know what she manages to consume), I hesitated to give her a bigger dose to check it out further.So I would suggest that this may help your dog, but it is likely up to your dog's constitution and personal response.Flavor wise, they were very effective, since both dogs were happy to test them out.",May help some dogs ...,3

Their stomachs are hardy, so they rarely have stomach upset when I change their food or give them new treats.  I typically feed them Merrick Grain Free and they had no issues switching to Instinct.Instinct Raw Boost contains freeze dried meat sprinkled in with regular kibble.  From looking at the food, I estimate there is about 5% free dried meat.  My older dog always eats the freeze dried bits first.  The younger one just chows down on her plate without seeming to notice the freeze dried bits.  Both finish their bowls completely, but neither is a picky eater.I'm not an expert but looking at the ingredients, I didn't see anything alarming.  My one concern about this food is that it is higher in fat and calories compared to the Merrick I have been feeding them.  Instinct Raw Boost contains about 495 calories per cup, while the Merrick contains 460.  Raw Boost contains 42% crude protein and 22% crude fat while the Merrick contains 38% and 17% respectively.I am feeding my dogs slightly less Instinct than Merrick due to the higher calories, fat, and protein in the Instinct.Overall, Instinct Raw Boost seems to be a high quality food that I feel safe feeding my dogs.

1501,katro,"My dog loves this toy, but I can't honestly give it a higher rating because it's not as durable as it could be. The rope is plastic and flimsy and the only thing that has kept my dog from completely chewing through it is the fact that I steal it from him every few mintues and toss it across the yard to play fetch. After only a few times of playing with this, my dog stripped the yellow/green fuzz off of it in a matter of mintues. Maybe if the quality of the materials used in the rope and the covering of this were better, I would feel more comfortable giving it a better rating.UPDATE 4/10/13: My dog bit this thing in half yesterday. I'm well aware that this is not a chew toy nor was I allowing my dog to use it as such, but in the minute or two between him running to me with it in his mouth and me grabbing it to toss it across the yard again, it ended up in two pieces and I had to throw it away.

The litter smell in the house decreased immediately. Previously, when I used regular clumping litter, it left a noticeable litter odor in the house. So I purchased the re-useable \""Forever Tray\"" and the \""Just the Crystals\"" from Amazon to avoid the expense of buying new pre-filled cartridges.

I throw out the old litter once a month and hose out the boxes. The smell in the house is gone even after moving both litter boxes to another room near the living room.

I didn't personally taste them, but they are slightly sticky with the stuff (not so sticky that they will leave a mark on anything, in my experience).  The dog can eat them easily, but my dog doesn't have a problem chewing anything.  I usually feed her raw meaty bones at least a couple times per week, and she often eats the bone entirely.And btw, I do think just giving her a real animal's bone is healthier.

The IAMS paste products don't seem to be as interesting to the cats, and it's hard for me to tell if there is real product there. The Fancy Feast actually looks like shredded/chopped turkey/beef/chicken.The produce is soft and always moist, making it very easy to eat.

I thought my dog would die, She had always been finiky, since  a year ago I have been having to feed her because she wouldn't self feed, then last week she started refusing to eat. I force fed her and that worked a few days until she started spitting out the food I put in her mouth, then she stopped drinking water! I thought  I would lose her. This product made her eat again! (I had taken her to the vet and all he said was she had digestive problems and for me to giver her oatmeal which I did) She licked the stuff i squirted from the tube slowly off a spoon and it seemed to make her a lil stronger in just a few hours, By the next day she was more lively and eagerly licked this off the spoon and told me she was HUNGREY! she does this by bringing me a treat she hid and that means she wants food (she's a super smart Chihuahua) This gave her her appetite back! second day she ate a little food and i didn't have to force feed her. I gave her one teaspoon the 1st night, 3 teaspoons the next day (one  a half hour before each meal) and then I waited  a half hour before i tried to give her any food. By the third morning she was no longer listless and she was running and jumping and looking for hidden treats to eat. She ate great! By the fourth day the sparkle is back in her eyes and she is acting like her old self again. I will always make sure I have a tube of this on hand.I changed her to an organic, grain free, high quality food. I also give her a half cup of cooked oatmeal per day to which i add diced apple and a squirt of organic honey. She has had chronic pancreatitus, I give her a digestive enzyme 5 min before meals too. Over time the pancreatitus damages the pancreas and makes it hard to digest food, eventually they get very little nutrients from food and waste away even though they are eating, then they lose interest in food which is what happened to her.

1521,I Do The Speed Limit,"""The first time our smaller-than-normal-size Miniature Schnauzer saw he had something new in his bowl, he got excited. Not as excited as when he foundChef Michael's Oven Roasted Chicken Dry Dog Food 11.5 Pound Bag, but that stubby little tail was sure a' waggin'!This is a side of our dog we had never seen when we fed him only Hills Prescription i/d.  He really wanted to eat this stuff!  Here's a little history:  Back when our dog was about 1 1/2 years old, he had some kind of gastrointestinal attack.  It was a scary 48 hours for all of us.  After $1000+ in vet bills, we still had no understanding of what happened.  Did he eat something he should not have?  Would the problem re-occur?  (Personally, in hindsight, we thought maybe he ate a seed from a Mountain Laurel.)  End result, though, was the vet put him on Hills Prescription Diet i/d.  He's been eating it now for 2-3 years.  That and any cut raw veggie he can get his teeth on.  His favorite is carrot coins, but he will scarf up cucumber, celery and zucchini slices; he will steal sugar snap peas,  green beans, swiss chard and bok choy from my garden basket while I'm harvesting.  While we can't keep him away from the veggies, we have to pick him up and place him in front of the Hills i/d and cajole him to eat it.So, we had been toying with the idea of taking a chance and switching it out for something else.  But what dog food to choose?  Then along came a few opportunities to sample some new dog foods.  The first he tried was the Chef Michael's Chicken, and then we compared it to the Rachael Ray Nutrish brand.  This Chicken and Veggies food has 4% more protein than the Hills, and 6% more fat.  It has 2% less chicken than Chef Michael's and 1% less fat.  Plus all the other goodies that an adult dog needs in about the same proportions as the Hills and Chef Michael's.  Our dog's stools are a bit stinkier, but they sure are easier for the dog to expel with that bit of extra fat.  It is a softer food, so we'll have to keep him better supplied with dental treats.  Serving size is the same for all three foods.While our dog likes Chef Michael's better, I think I like the Nutrish Chicken and Veggies better.  Why?  Because it has more fiber, even more fiber than the Hills i/d.  (Hills is 3.5%; Chef Michael's is 3% and this is 4%.)  And if our dog really has permanent gastrointestinal issues, I think more fiber is better for him.  Maybe we'll switch between one and the other.  Or maybe we'll mix the two together and see how that goes.But, most importantly, our dog is having no issues with this new food at this time, and he sure seems happier and \""bouncier\"".  When his bowl goes down, he treats it like he's getting a Greenie--and he loves his Greenies.Of course, one month's time--some of it spent in changing over from one food to the next--is not long enough to really know whether we can permanently get rid of the Hills i/d, and I will update this review further down the line.  But, so far, so good:  We're glad we took a chance and made a change.""",We are switching from Hills Prescription i/d to this and Chef Michael's,5

These bags are easy to use; there are perforations between each bag that make them easy to separate as you unroll a roll. At 9 inches by 12 inches, these bags are also long enough to easily put a knot in the end to close the bag tightly after 'use'.As another reviewer stated, there are many poop bags out there that meet our requirements perfectly -- so what makes these better than those others? Simply stated, the great bulk price. 1,000 bags delivered to our doorstep for a total cost of 1 1/2 cents per bag... just over a penny per bag... yessir, that's the ticket.We live in a country neighborhood and really don't care what our poop bag carrier looks like; we just toss a few bags in our pocket when going for a stroll. Don't care much about the color of the bags, and our neighbors don't spend much time judging others by poop bag color either. Am glad that these don't have that little plastic center roll in the middle, as those darned things just cluttered up our mud-room drawers.These bags are easy to use, reliable and very affordable.

He immediately went to licking the inside paste as much as he could, then he started chewing the hard edges around it. He's working both sides of the bone and is slowly wearing the outside down, chewing as much inside as he can, then starts working the outside edge again.Now, this is a dog who usually will take rib bones and swallow them whole, or take the rawhide bones and break them in half with his powerful jaws. For some reason, he didn't crush this one (I think ti's because of the stuff inside it) and he has actually had it for about two months, slowly chewing on the edges and working it down. He's tried to take it outside and bury it a few times, and then settled on burying it in the couch when we wouldn't let him, so we've had to remind him where it is and retrieve it for him a few times, but once we give it back to him, he starts chewing all over again.if he ever finally eats it all up, we'll be ordering a new one for him.

1593,D. Fowler,"""One of the things I don't like to see in a so-called \""natural\"" dog food are ingredients that are really off-the-wall ingredients, but I'm not seeing anything in here except perhaps the debatable Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex.  My dogs aren't going to eat piles of this ingredient, so the issue is rather a moot point.  I really go over dog food ingredients with my vet because I have one dog whose seizure activity can be exacerbated by treats or foods.  People often start yelling about things like corn not being digestible, allergies to wheat and/or soy, but if you object to it, you can simply pass.  My vet is not overly alarmed at the corn because, as she claims, it's a vegetable.  My dogs don't have allergies to either wheat or corn so I'm fine with it.The ingredients are fairly similar to another dog food I'm using for my small dog and if it creates any problems we'll switch foods.

1599,Just My Op,"...and it's made in the USA.I've bought and discarded two previous litter catcher products.  Both claimed to significantly reduce the mess created by my less-than-dainty kitties, and both failed.  They were more bother than they were worth.So I was skeptical about this one.  Once again, I am wrong.After the disappointment with the previous two products I'd used, I settled for squares of carpet, frequently swept or vacuumed but disposed when they were too dirty, or an old bath mat which worked fairly well and could be washed, shaking off the litter between washings.  Both solutions had serious drawbacks.This trap mat really does work well although I'm not quite sure why.  It feels like plastic carpeting but has big, loopy strands of plastic that really do catch the litter.  I originally put the bathmat under this mat to see how much litter scattered past the mat.  (It's hard to see the litter on the tile itself and I hate finding it by crunching it when I walk on it.)  There was not very much scattered litter on the bathmat.  There was a bit on the tile where the mat and bathmat are narrowest, but again, not much.Update:  An ill cat made a nasty mess on this product so I took it outside and hosed it off -- worked great!I was afraid that my cats wouldn't like the texture, and none of us want to do anything to dissuade our kitties from using the litter box.  Mine didn't even hesitate, but then, my kitties are very laid back.The only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of five is that the size I got, the smaller size, really does need to be bigger to lessen that scattered litter.  I think that people ordering the smaller one, thinking that the litter box they have is not oversized, will be disappointed.  The small one would not be good at all with an open litter box where the mat needs to overlap all sides, and I think that perhaps even the large one wouldn't be as helpful as it could be.  Even with a covered litter box, only one way in and out, the smaller one is too small.  Other than the available sizes, I really like this product.",Works Better Than Others I've Tried...,4

It does contain a few ingredients that we would never use at home, but this also doesn't require refrigeration.  It works for us, they are happy, and nobody gets sick.  What more could we ask for, especially since it's the canine version of an MRE for us?  It also says something that dogs that are used to receiving meals that consist of cooked brown rice & vegetables mixed with raw meat will regard ANY kibble as \""delicious\"".""",Even the picky eaters love it,4

Instead of just sniffing the food and walking away, he instantly eats it as soon as I put the bowl down.  I have read that canned dog food is much better than the dry kibble because there is less chemicals and although a meal consisting of only canned food could be pretty pretty expensive with a big dog like mine, adding the canned food into his dry allows him to get the benefits of the canned food, makes him eat more consistently, and even ends up saving you money.

1623,Neutralist,"The foam prevents any small creatures from getting into the filter intake, but clogs too easily in a planted tank setup where weekly maintenance is barely enough to return the foam to reasonable flow.  However, this is expected with a dense foam filter like this.  The use of this pre-filter prolongs the maintenance of the actual filter media since the larger contaminants are blocked from entering the main filter.  The biggest risk is if you are on vacation for a week and the foam clogs, restricting the filter flow to a point where there is no water circulation.  Yes, I have crashed a 45 gallon tank due to this so I learned the hard way.I'm giving full 5 stars since the foam itself works and the high maintenance aspect is equally demanding with all other foam materials.","Excellent value and functionality, but high maintenance",5

1651,It's Just Me,"""When I adopted my two 3 year old neutered males from the local animal control, I knew only that one was a stray and the other came from a family home and had been surrendered.  The cats loved each other right away, and that was great.  I did wonder why the one cat, \""Spot,\"" had been surrendered.  He seemed friendly, talkative, and loving.Well... 4 years later, I was at my wits' end with him.  About 6 months after I got him, he began pulling coats and towels off hooks to pee on them.  I had to binderclip my towels to the bars (explain that to a guest...) and rehang my coat hooks up a foot higher.  He would still use the litterbox, mind you.  Then, he began meowing loudly whenever I went in a room and closed the door.  Then he began to do it when I fixed his food.  Then, he began to viciously bite my feet, to the point where I would bleed for over 20 minutes and had 2\"" cuts.This cat has no health problems and his life is fairly stress-free.  He loves his cat friend, has no issues with the dog.  No outside cats come around, and he doesn't want to go outside.  He's just a highly-stressed individual.I tolerate a lot, but after four unprovoked attacks on me, several on the dog, and sudden fight-starting with the other cat, I figured it was either rehome the bad kitty in a barn somewhere or give him Prozac.I found this product while looking for reviews on Feliway.  I went to Petco and decided to buy both the Feliway diffuser and this collar, and to return the diffuser if the collar worked.Well, it's been a few days, but the results have been great so far.  No meowing outside my door in the morning!  He just meows maybe once or twice while I'm making his food.  The chronic screeching meows are gone!  He doesn't follow me everywhere or pace as much.  Even his rather histrionic purring has toned down to a normal level.  He is more mellow, and so far I have not seen any peeing attempts or fighting attempts (but these are generally spread out over time, so I'll edit this again in a month or so).I will definitely be buying this product again if it keeps on being this awesome.  After four years of living with psycho-cat, these last few days have been like a happy feline fairy tale.  Keeping my fingers crossed and will update in a month...""",Neurotic-No-More,5

1658,Amazon Customer,"""I bought this at Amazon for under $50 and it's a great product. It's probably not as great as the $150 clippers on the market, but it is definitely better than items in it's price range, and I just didn't want to put down over $100 without knowing if i would even stick to clipping my own dog. But after receiving these and now having done 2 hair cuts, I am very happy I chose this one. I don't recommend spending over $60 for it, and usually it's less here, so if it's more, just wish list it and wait, i'll come down.First of all, i LOVE that it's cordless, love. SO glad i got a cordless clipper. As for the clippers, I use them on a dog with fine, cottony hair and it does a great job. My cuts don't come out looking great because I haven't really taken the time, so i can't say whether my fine cottony haired dog needs expensive clippers to get there, but I am so happy with these. My dog is 8lbs and it takes me less than half hour to cut his hair down from over an inch long to a half inch all over. I live in nyc where it costs $75! for a grooming session! Ridiculous. With these i just put my dog on the ironing board (that's his grooming table) and go for it. My dog is scared of the hair dryer but not these clippers! that is great. If you go on Wahl's youtube channel they have tons of videos on how to use them. I never even bothered with those, i just aim to make the hair shorter and it works. I Would definitely buy these clippers again. After much research before buying, i know I made the right choice. Oh, and the rest of the kit, i tossed the scissors, the mirror and the case, they're pretty useless.Update: I just finished my 5th home haircut and it is the best cut so far, actually looks pretty decent! Yay! that means i've saved 75 x 5 - 40, $335! : ). If this one pooped out at anytime then and only then would I even consider getting on of the $150 high end models, but I am so glad I got this one my first go around and may even buy it again if it poops out.update: i just learned that the battery in this is replaceable! That is great. It is $20 on amazon. But I also see that you can get an Andis AGC single speed (not cordless), which are supposed be better, on *bay for about $90 and $100 on amazon. The andis gives you more options, like more blades that fit and the ability to use Wahl stainless steel combs, which are supposed to be awesome, but i do like my wahl. I just ordered an andis and I will update my review after I've tried it.Update: Just tried my new Andis single speed, it is better than the wahl in some ways, in some ways worse.Andis $100+ Single Speed heavy duty vs. $50ish Wahl Pro Series-The biggest difference (and the biggest benefit) is that the Andis can use blades of different lengths, instead of plastic comb attachments, and blades by themselves are always better than plastic attachments, especially if you have a few knots. I really liked using a 4FC blade, i was able to take off more hair with each run of the clipper than the wahl because of the dedicated blade and i was able to push through knots.-But my goodness, the blade on the andis gets hot soooo fast. At least 2-3x as fast as the Wahl. It got pretty hot after 10-15 minutes and then had to stop every 5 minutes and take off the hot blade and put it under a bag of frozen peas. A serious pita.-Using the Andis made me realize how much better it is to have a cordless clipper.-The $100+ Andis is about the same sound volume as the Wahl pro series. The Andis is about 50%+ heavier than the Wahl and I can feel it, blech.The haircut with the andis didn't seem to look any better than with the Wahl (maybe a tad because with dedicated blades there are few tracks than with snap on combs), and although the motor is slightly better on the Andis, and even though it cut faster, really wasn't a big deal, esp since my dog is small, and i feel like the amount of time i had to spend cooling this thing off negated most of my time saving. During the haircut, while waiting for the blade on the Andis to cool down i did some scissor work on the face and used the Wahl without any attachments to do the sanitary trims (or whatever i needed that #10 blade for).  That being said, I have a single coated dog. For those who have dogs with a thick undercoat, i can't say for sure that the wahl will do what you need.I wouldn't necessarily give up my wahl for the more expensive, professional andis pair; the heat and the cord are a real PITA. And for the Wahl to be as good as it is, and actually be cordless, it is exceptional for the price. I actually like having both.Oh, AND, the cordless wahl is great because 1/2 hour after finishing my dog's haircut i saw something i wanted to even out. No problemo, the Wahl was easier to just grab and cut, no unravelling a cord, plugging in, etc.Update 3/13. I've done quite a few haircuts now. I use both my Andis and my Wahl when i do a haircut. I start with the andis just because i don't have to use an attachment because of the aforementioned ability to use a dedicated blade in the length of my choice. But i really disliked the cord so i sold my Andis single speed on ebay and ordered a Wahl Bravura, and kept my Pro-series. Wahl has a well-liked clipper named \""Bravura\"". Groomers on message boards praise it, it's about $150, and you'll want to buy the stainless steel combs for $35/$40 (but for the andis, same thing, SS combs or more blades) and it's 11 ounces which is still heavier than the pro-series but 6 ounces lighter than the Andis. So if you are looking for a clipper under $60, the Wahl Pro-series is so great, but if you are looking for a slightly faster haircut, and want a more professional look that plastic combs can't always give (unless you know how to use a pair of scissors well), don't go for the Andis, look into the Wahl Bravura instead.Oh, and btw, if you want to go that extra step in your grooms, as in, an adorable haircut on a malt or yorkie, westie, whatever, I recently bought a few of Jodi Murphy's dvds and my grooms are so much better. They're $35 on cherrybrook, petedge and jodimurphy.net (and the resale value is pretty high on ebay/amazon). My last groom i only used my $50 Wahl Pro-series, and a $20 pair of scissors and he looks great.1 last update: Sold the Andis pair (too heavy) and bought the Wahl Bravura ($150-$180), which is the grown up brother to this pair, the Pro-series. Both cordless, both light. The Bravura has a stronger motor and can be used with stainless steel combs. I'll always keep my original wahl, but now that i have a bravura i'll use that pretty much exclusively. But for the price, the wahl pro-series is great. Without a doubt the best in it's price range.""","Agree, great item for the money",4

1660,J. Smith,"I have two rescue cats, about three years old.  My boy kitty has been anxious since I brought him home, meowing constantly and straight-up howling at night.  I wasn't getting any sleep, which was affecting my own health and sanity.  When he started attacking my other cat I tried everything.  I did the reintroduction, positive association, even the squirt of water (worst idea ever -- don't do this!).Like others, I was a little skeptical that this would work.  I live in a big place (about 1900 sq.ft) and didn't want to spend money on several of these, but I also didn't want to re-home one of my cats.  So as a last resort I bought two and plugged in one upstairs and one downstairs, in areas where they pass by frequently.  They both went up and sniffed it right away.  My boy cat jumped backwards and didn't go near it again, but my girl has been hanging out by it.Fast forward three days.  Despite the reaction to sniffing it up close, my bully boy has totally mellowed out.  I woke up this morning feeling strangely refreshed, because it was the first time in months that I got a full night's sleep.  He still stalks her a little bit, but when she hisses he backs off right away.  I'm really shocked, and beyond thrilled.  He used to walk around the house all day not sleeping, but now he curls up next to me on the couch and actually snores.  Have you ever heard a cat snore?  It's the cutest thing in the world.I totally get that it won't work for everyone.  Every cat is different with all sorts of emotional and behavioral issues that probably need to be rooted out.  But why not give this a shot?  I'm so glad that I did.  Oh, and buy it here on Amazon because Petco has it for nearly double the price.**UPDATE**  It's been several months and I wanted to confirm that this stuff DOES work.  The weather has been getting warmer so I've been opening windows.  The cats have started fighting again.  One day I saw the vapor from the Feliway going out the window and realized it's getting diluted by the outside air.  I closed all the windows and after a day the fighting stopped again.  It kind of sucks that I'm dependent on this stuff, but it's MUCH better than the alternative of having them fight every day.","Wow, it's working!",5

As another reviewer has said the opening for the boots are VERY small, but after working with it and stretching it for a minute I was able to easily fit it over my Golden Retriever's foot and the tightness ensures that he can't get them off.

1667,"""B. Adams \""goldfinger\""""","This cover is nice and thick to protect the seats and has many details I didn't expect. There is an elastic strap on each side of the bench portion to help keep the cover in place. I put this is my 2005 Tacoma and it fits perfectly. There are also slits built in for access to the seat belts.  Dog hair seems to vacuum off of the cover pretty easily, unlike fleece (this feels like quilted cotton.) There is good looking hardware and straps to hold the seat back in place, and this is the only part I wish I could change. The straps seem like a good idea, but they don't do a great job of keeping the corners secured. It needs something similar to what Solvit put on the bench part...elastic straps. Then maybe the hardware would do a better job since it would only need to hold the cover up. You'll see what I mean. This is the best dog seat cover I've seen. In case you're wondering, the color is almost an army green, but goes really well with my grey interior. It almost looks dark grey in lower light. I think it would go good with tan interior too.

1668,P. Smith,"Well I thought I had the most persnickity cat on the face of the earth and she only got worse with age.  I'm on a fixed income so I have to admit I've never tried giving her designer cat foods or cat foods only sold at the vets but over the years I've tried just about every dry and wet cat food that's deemed nutritious for our felines that's found in most super markets.  It was always the same.  The first day she'd act like I'd finally found her heart's delight.  But no matter how much she liked it she'd only eat half of whatever I gave her.  If I gave her half a can, she'd eat half of that.  If I gave her 1 tablespoon she'd leave half of it in the bowl.  The second day she wasn't as enthusiastic and by day five she wouldn't want anything to do with the new fare.The one well known popular cat food I never bought was Fancy Feast.  Call me crazy but there was just something about the ads on TV and their advertising that just turned me off.  Let's face it...it's not cheap at $1.29 a can in the grocery store.  My cat is a sweet, smart as a whip, loving country gal.  She doesn't eat out of a crystal bowl and if you tried to but a diamond studded collar on her she'd throw a tissy fit.  Fancy Feast just didn't fit her profile.After a few issues having to do with old age started creeping in she became even more finicky.  The vet said she was the perfect weight with a nice coat so I knew she wasn't underfed or malnourished but she had stopped eating.  One day I saw this Fancy Feast deal on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  To make a longer story short.......she loves it.  It's been a little over a month now and she still asks for breakfast and dinner every day and FINISHES the whole serving I give her.  Amazon makes this cat food affordable for me.

I tried three other products and all helped some, but none eliminated enough of the odor that we couldn't smell urine when coming into the room with the couch (at first they'd work, but slowly the smell would get worse again).  So, in a last ditch effort to avoid having to get rid of it, we decided to try X-O.  Just as with the other products, I used a needle/syringe to inject the solution into the cushion and the back (our cushions are not removable).  I used a 1 part X-O to 2 parts water for this.  After injecting it, I poured the mix on top of the cushion to give it a good soaking.So far, so good.  It's been over a month.  The product's odor was a bit overwhelming for a day or so, but just as the mfr states, there was no odor once dried.  Also gone was the majority of the urine odor.  If I put my nose right next to the cushion, there's still a hint, so I'm thinking I may need to reapply, but when I sit on, or next to the cushion, I cannot smell it.  At first I worried that perhaps I'd just gotten used to the urine smell, but I've asked both friends and family if they could smell anything nasty when they walk in the room or when they sit on the couch, and all have said they can't (and I know, for sure, my parents and at least two of the friends would not have been shy about saying there is a stench!)The only downside is, my dark green couch now has dark outlines along the edges of every area where I applied the solution.  We knew this was a possibility going into this, but hubby and I decided that discoloration of some kind was preferable to having to either live with the smell or getting rid of the couch.  And, I'm not entirely sure that if I were to now try to clean the couch that the stains wouldn't go away, particularly since the fabric didn't fade.  But even if it had, it would have been well worth it.After my success, I applied this to the carpet at my mother's house (no discoloration or staining occurred) where her kitten had taken to going poo in a few spots along a wall when she first brought it home.  We used the same ratio for the mix and just poured it onto the carpet and let it soak in.  The kitten has not reoffended since.  She now does her business only in her litter box.********Update:  My mom's kitty went poo in the corner today, but I'm so happy with my couch results I can't take a star off for this.  I just wanted to share what happened because we thought the kitten wouldn't do it again after us putting the x-o there.  She's not quite 3 months old.  Not sure what is attracting her to this spot.  She's not done this anywhere else in the house.  Will reapply and see if that helps.",Dearest X-O ... I Love You!,5

It just absorbs and clumps hard making clean up easy and not leaving any odor at all. It is clay and not meant to be flushed. The urine doesn't seem to go through the litter and stick to the bottom of the box as easily as with other brands.  I was also pleasantly surprised that it doesn't track as much as some of the others, which I thought would be a problem with the clay, but it is very minimal. It isn't the cheapest litter out there, but not the most expensive either and the price varies quite a bit, so shop around.Also, my cats took to it immediately, unlike others that I had to mix gradually in to what they were used to.

NovAqua calls its product a \""bandage in a bottle\"" for fresh and salt water fishes, pond fish and invertebrates. It has the additives I recommend everyone use to help a fish make and preserve their essential slime coat and adds electrolytes to maintain a proper osmotic balance for gill function. It also removes toxic metals like copper, stabilizes pH and balances alkalinity.The conditioner does not remove chloramines, but then, most chlorine conditioners don't either (Tetra Aqua's AquaSafe is an exception that does both). Kordon makes NovAqua, and they have a similar product called Amquel, which is specific for chloramines. The two products can be used in conjunction if your municipal water supply adds chloramine (you will have to call them to check - you can't tell at home).I would prefer the product come with a way to measure out larger dosages (rather than just drops), but I like that this product comes with an electrolyte enhancer.The 8 fl oz bottle is a good price for the size and comes with an nice squeeze top. Since all you need is a drop per gallon, it lasts a good long time.

With these two dogs, I have to re-fill the fountain about every other day. They both drink a lot of water so it goes pretty quick. The fountain keeps the water cool and is not stagnant. There is a filter that sits above the water reservoir that collects and debris so it doesn't fall into the bowl. I have to was out the fountain and filter about once a week or else the filter will get to saturated with dirt and dirt will end up in the water reservoir. Cleaning is easy, you can take the whole thing apart and hand wash. There are 4 pieces to the fountain; water reservoir, pump, filter holder, and lid. These all snap in together and snap off to clean. The pump stays put at the base of the water reservoir by four suction cups so you can remove it to clean the reservoir. The filter holder basically sits right above the pump and snaps onto the top of the reservoir. This is where the filter lays. The lid is where the water comes through.The manufacturer customer service is great.

Once the carpet begins to shred, it's important to get rid of them so your cat(s) won't ingest the carpet fibers.

The one I just replaced lasted for over five years of constant abuse.  Yes, it wobbled back and forth slightly when my cat ran up it, but it never seemed unsafe.  I guess it just comes down to expectations.  If you expect this to be as solid as the standalone cat trees, you'll be disappointed, but that doesn't mean this one is poorly made.  It's just different since it relies on the spring pressure to hold it in place.  I also think that there are those people who expect a Mercedes for a Yugo price.

The Large Max Glow Balls are much more suited for larger dogs. The large ones also glow brighter and longer than the medium and small ones do. Although, the glow doesnt last very long. I would guess they glow for about ten minutes before they begin to loose their glow. To recharge, just stick them under a light for a few seconds and your good to go. The glow is definitely helpful when trying to find them at night and in the dark. They are much lighter than other ChuckIt Balls. Much safer for indoor use.

1774,Daniel,"First, some background on my dog. He is a rescue dog whom I got in May 2013. After a month of having him his true nature started coming out. I found out he can be a puller and did not like other dogs. He would lunge at dogs and bicycles. I was using a regular collar on him but he would pull and would go after other dogs on walks. He also developed a habit of barking when I got to a house that he knew had a dog. So, even if other dogs were not barking at him if he remembered the house he would start barking which made it hard to walk him in the morning. My dog is 30 lbs, I am over 200 so it is not like he was stronger than me. But I knew this was a bad habit of his.I got the Easy Walk in hopes it would keep him from pulling. With the Easy Harness he did get better in not pulling as much but would still pull at times. But, it did nothing to curb his lunging at dogs and bikes. It was getting frustrating walking him as he would bark at no apparent reason. If you know how to use it, this collar can be helpful in training your dog to not pull as much. But, don't expect miracles, you still need to do your part to train your dog.Fast forward 3 months to the head halter. I heard about gentle leader but was apprehensive in getting it. In putting on the gentle leader my dog did fuss and not want it on him. He would try to take it off by pawing at it and rubbing his face on bushes. It has been 5 days and still does it but he is getting used to it. Reward him with treats after so he associates as positive. So does it work? YES! But, be sure you know how to use it. Watch the DVD! it is important you don't send your dog mixed signals by keeping it tense. On our first walk the dog did pull and lunge but he did not like the feeling, especially when lunging. But on our first walk I could tell he was staying by my side much better. I did not expect it to prevent lunging but it has. I think it makes him think twice. I have taken him past houses where dogs will bark it him, in the past he would try to go to the barking but now he just whimpers and keeps walking. This produce truly is working wonders (the gentle leader).So in short, I would recommend both the Easy Walk and Gentle Leader. If you have a problem it does not hurt to try both and see which one works better for your dog. But keep in mind you have to do your part to still train your dog. These products are meant as tools. For my purpose, Gentle Leader has done wonders.",Easy Walk vs. Gentle Leader,4

He's the kind of dog that within 30 seconds of having his bowl put down, devours all the food so quickly that sometimes I have to stop and think if I actually fed him or if I&#34;m just remembering feeding him yesterday. With this food though, he leaves it sitting there all day and only goes back for it when he's starving. Sometimes when my dog doesn't eat, he throws up from the bile in his stomach. We haven't had that problem with the last food but now that we're at 50% old food and 50% new food, he's started forgetting to eat again.

1788,E. Anderson,"Last weekend I had just completed a water change for my two male Bettas when I noticed that the temperature was 72 degrees. For Bettas, they need to be in water that is at least 74 to 76 degrees. So I made a unexpected run to the nearest major pet retail store and bought the Mini Heater. The tanks I have is a 1 gallon Mini Bow junior Aquarium and a large Kritter Keeper. I found that the Mini Heater was ideal for the Kritter Keeper. The temperature of the water got to the ideal temperature for my Betta Osirius which was 78 degrees and remained at that temperature over night. The Mini Heater in my Mini Bow aquarium heated up too quickly and got as high as 82 degrees (this led me to order online a new larger home for my other Betta Anubis). I really like how silent the heater is. I think this heater is more appropriate for 2 gallon tanks than 5 gallon tanks judging by a few less than impressed reviewers. I am thinking that the more room and water in the tank, the less higher the temperatures will rise). For Betta owners who have smaller tanks and bowls than 5 gallons, I wholeheartedly would recommend this heater.",Ideal for Betta owners,5

1791,killthebananas,"""My dog usually scarfs her food down so fast she practically chokes. I decided to try a kibble toy to slow her down. I decided on this one over the tug-a-jug because my dog is crazy and throws things around when she gets excited. I thought the tug-a-jug would probably end up getting thrown into the TV or something. This works really well to slow my dog down when eating. Now she only gets a few pieces at a time, which is great, and dinner is now a fun game for her. It's really cute to watch her run around the house, tail wagging, chasing this egg and the kibble trail it leaves behind. This kibble toy holds a lot of dog food. There is plenty of room for my dogs normal serving, which is probably about 2 cups. The rubber prongs at the openings are easy to trim. I cut very small pieces off at first (less than 1/4\"" at a time) to make sure I didn't over do it. Then I filled it with food and let my dog play with it. I feed my dog Purina Beneful, just for a size reference. At first only about one piece would come out at a time. Now, after a few trimmings, I have it so that about 4 or 5 pieces of kibble fall out at a time. This seems to be the magic number to keep my dog's interest. It's holding up well to rolling around the house and banging into stuff, but it would definitely not hold up to being chewed on. My dog doesn't try to chew on it now that a decent amount of kibble comes out, but she did when only 1 or 2 pieces were falling out at a time. After she gets down to about 1/4 cup of kibble she has trouble making it fall out, so I dump it into her bowl. It makes quite a bit of noise when rolled around on hard floors, but it doesn't really bother me. I highly recommend!""",Fun way to feed kibble!,5

1803,"""Lone Alaskan Gypsy \""Lone Alaskan Gypsy\""""","I've tried a lot of canned dog foods. Pedigree is one of my 'okay' brands. I like them because they are so affordable. But there are a few better quality choices out there. This particular variety I'm not the biggest fan of. But it has it's positives. These cans are your normal 'dog food sized' cans. They are an adequate meal size for a medium sized dog. For smaller dogs half the can will do. For large and extra large dogs two to three cans would suffice. They have an 'easy open tab' on the top so you don't need a can opener to access the food. They also come neatly packaged in plastic-wrapped sets of 6. Total you receive 24. Two sets of 6 ground chicken and two sets of 6 ground beef.When you open the can the odor is a bit 'off'. It smells kind of like canned corned beef hash. Not really a dog-friendly smell. There are better brands out there when it comes to smell quality. My two larger malamute dogs are very picky and do not like the odor of this food. They smell it and then turn their heads away. They won't eat it unless they are hungry. I honestly blame this on the smell rather than the actual food taste- as they don't even try it. Their noses turn them away from it.The meat quality itself is also lacking. It's pink in color. This, I find odd, in canned meats. Most canned meats turn a brownish color (chicken would turn white). But these ground ones remain pink. I'm not sure if this is normal of ground meats when they are canned. But it gives me the impression that a lot of unhealthy preservatives are involved in the canning of these meats. There is also a clear gel on the meats that is similar to the gel on Spam. Not exactly appetizing. I'm not sure if it is fat or some other preservative. The texture of this meat is just like glop. It needs to be spooned out of the can and into a bowl. It's kind of like meat jello. I could see how this would be great for older dogs and dogs with weak jaws or sensitive teeth. This food would be very easy for them to eat. It could even be watered down and the dogs wouldn't even have to use their teeth. They could just drink it up. It'd also be great for force-feeding sick animals because of it's thin texture.I fed a litter of 8 puppies this food. They loved it and gobbled it up throughout the first two weeks of their weaned life before they were adopted out. I actually bought this food specifically for puppies. It's a great weaning food for them. The texture is very easy for them to eat and the oily-ness (rather than dryness of dry food) is easy on their digestive system. All puppies gained appropriate weight on this food and had nice coats. I'd definitely recommend it for young dogs.On the other hand my two large dogs won't even touch this stuff. My Chihuahua won't either. They're all accustomed to fresh meat and this food just didn't do them justice. I don't think I'll be buying it again unless I find myself with more newly weaned puppies.","For The Price, It's Good",3

Also, there was a lot of crumb/food dust inside the bag.

1808,jasl,"Bear (100 lb.+ Euro dobe) loves Louisiana Alligator Jerky.  I reserve this treat for walks - put a couple of handfuls in my treat pouch and the soft biscuit is easy to break into smaller bite sizes. Bear is rewarded when he looks up at me encouraging focus and discouraging distracted behaviors.  Breaking the soft biscuit into smaller pieces makes this treat a super value - at less than $.50/ oz. the smaller pieces make the single biscuits go further.  I particularly like the fact that alligator is the first ingredient and that alligator is a very healthy protein source.  True, there is some residue at the bottom of the bag but I just add that to Bear's dinner (Acana duck and pear mixed with Evanger's pheasant) so no product is wasted.  Since Bear requires a restricted diet, the hypoallergenic aspect of Alligator Jerky provides a nice variety to his food sources.  For some reason, the seller seems to make a difference - Firefly Buys' product has arrived generally intact -- a tad more expensive than the current lowest price but worth the price not to have to return a bag of crumbles.UPDATE May 2014:  Sorry to say that - as other recent reviewers have noted - the most recent batch of Alligator Jerky consists of about half crumbs/ a few whole treats and the remainder broken paws.

1815,ECW,"""I bought this pump a few years back from my LFS. It seemed good - it was cheap, looks nice and sleek, and comes with an adjustable air setting. I bought a few of them. The first one I tried was nice and quiet at first but after a month or so the noise became unbearable. I got it out of my room - the whole tank and all and put it in the dining room. My dad commented that it is the loudest pump that he has ever heard and that he wanted it out! The second one was even louder (it was larger and had room for two air hoses). That one seemed to be a \""lemon\"" because after a couple of weeks it was incredibly noisy. I eventually went to another LFS and they gave me a tetra tec deep water 18 pump for free that I truly loved. I used it with no problems and no noise for at least 6 years. I recently had a need for a spare pump and plugged the quieter JW fusion air pump in and it has developed into an incredible loud buzzing/humming noise as bad as the larger JW pump I have. I didnt even know air pumps could be so LOUD! It is just as strong as comparable pumps and does its job but the quietness they claim lasts for an incredibly short time. On a brighter note, after the LFS introduced me to Tetra pumps I have never gone back to anything else. Recently I bought the new tetra 10 pump to replace the free tetra tec deepwater 18 pump that was given to me by my LFS. The tetra tec is still pretty quiet and still only produces a slight hum and could use a repair(see my other review), but since the tank is in my room and pumps are cheap I decided to replace it. I am super happy with my purchase as it is the quietest pump that I have ever owned and let's me sleep at night comfortably. Thank you Tetra. Don't waste your money on pumps by JW buy a Tetra!Edit: Since I recived so many negative/unhelpful ratings on my comment of this product, and it has so many good reviews... I decide to give it another chance. I actually had a new one stashed away (500 model). At first it had good power and this one was actually quiet! Out of three of them I got one quiet one. Wow, maybe it was time to delete my review? I ran it for around four months and it was quiet and did it's job well and I was starting to be impressed. I had the two outlets combined into one to run a Hydro sponge filter and during my maintenence I decided to check if both otlets still produced air pressure. Well one of them failed! Just one of the outlets still gave out enough air to power the sponge, but still a dissapointment none the less. Will I be buying another JW air pump? NO CHANCE IN HELL! Tetra is BETTER! I have a couple tetra whispers so old and used that the blue has turned purple. They are still strong and QUIET! I have a tetratec DW 96-2 thats REALLY old, repaired it once and it still works like champ! It's... I don't know how many times larger than the JW500 but just as quiet and MUCH more powerfull! For all you that have given me a negative, or plan to. Buy it and try it for a while first, compare it to a tetra model (I wouldn't reccomend a tetra whisper air pump in the higher models... If you need something for a larger application shell out some cash and get the tetratec. Hell, get the tetratec anyways they are the best diaphragm style air pumps!) and then rate my comment.

Anna Nicole is enormous, has enough fur for herself and at least one other animal, and an attitude that some might call 'entitled.'  Others might say 'rabid.'  She looks like a long-haired Siamese, white with pale gray and peach markings, and is quite beautiful, unless you cheese her off. Then all you see is Teeth and Size.  She moves fast for a big 'un.Anyway, Anna Nicole (aka AhNo) developed a sizable mat on her chest.  I wanted to cut it off, but we have this basic disagreement of philosophies when I get out the brush and scissors.  I try to be gentle, she tries to kill me.  And I'm terrified that as she wriggles and twists, I'm liable to hurt her.  To make a long story short, I used the comb as a guard.  First I got it in position under the mat, took the pet grooming scissors (they have a ball at the end of the blades, instead of a point...no accidental jabbing of critter or human) and started cutting. What surprised me is that the grooming comb was also working to gently separate the hairs, sort of dematting as it protected AhNo's skin.  She had some mats-in-the-making on her tummy, which combed out quite easily. You just sort of wriggle and glide the comb and it gets through the tangles without pulling. Scissors help where the mat is severe.Brushing does keep the mats from forming, but this cat is a mat factory.  The comb is non-invasive and takes out a lot of loose hairs when I groom her. She has not minded me combing her and kind of likes it.  Her sister, Jane Air (also known as &#34;Please come out, I know you're around somewhere) appeared briefly to look confused and go back behind whatever it is she goes behind.  I'm afraid she is the kind of cat the other cats would whisper about. If I ever see her again, I'll try the comb on her.  She doesn't bite.  Her trick is waiting until I'm asleep in bed and then diving on my stomach from the big dresser.Still, they're mine and I love them.

We love the whole concept of this system, the crystals are awesome at absorbing the odor, the tines never clump. However, it is pricey to buy in essence a cardboard box with some crystals in it for this much money. So we experimented and found a solution.Instead, we take their cardboard box and spray it with a regular spray lacquer like you find at any Michael's store - a few coats. That makes it waterproof. Then we buy standard crystals at a WalMart. We get a ton of uses out of it, and just wash the box itself out every few weeks. We have two cats - one an 18 pounder, so rather large. He doesn't have any issues at all with this. I'll note that he doesn't have his front claws, but our smaller cat (8 pounds or so) is fully clawed and hasn't had any issues with this either. No \""claws through the cardboard\"" or anything.  I imagine if you had some sort of tear-happy kitty you could reinforce the bottom with a sheet of plexiglass very easily, which would be quite washable and durable too.For us, however, that wasn't necessary. Yes we might have to buy one of these every number of months to get a fresh, clean box to start with, but other than that you can certainly \""create your own\"" without having to buy their units.I'm not sure how to rate the unit then.

I have two dogs about 5 pounds each and they both fit in it. A while back I got into a car accident with both of them in my car and they were both just sitting on the passenger seat; they flew off the seat, hit the air bag and ended up on the floor. Luckily they were not injured. Now I will not take them in the car without being seatbelted in. This easily seatbelts in and out. It's very convenient as well to have them in the carrier in the car and be able to just pick the carrier up and carry them around if I need to when we reach our destination (it has soft handles). It zip opens on the top and the front. I leave the top open because my dogs won't jump out and then I unzip the front to let them out. This was an excellent purchase. It has made things a lot easier for me when taking them places and makes me feel secure that they are in a soft flexible carrier safely seat belted in the car. And it's very stylish.

I've noticed that when he's already in a relatively calm mood then these will really mellow him out and he gets sleepy and affectionate (which I love) but if he's in one of his crazy high-strung moods (which is most of the time) then I don't notice a change in his behavior. Even if I give him two chews rather than one he still acts pretty crazy. I have to crate him at night (again, he's a pretty crazy little guy...) and I like to give him a chew before bed because I know he'll mellow out with it and sleep. However I also wipe his crate down with the Feliway wipes that admit a cat pleasing pheromone so I'm sure that helps quite a bit too.In my opinion these chews are worth a try, but don't expect miracles.","These chews work ok, but don't expect miracles.",3
1837,Shelley Cotton,"I have nothing but good things to say about the brick product. The price was great compared to pet stores, there is a million ways to customize the difficulty, and the quality is excellent. This is the first game that I bought for my dog and it has helped immensely. I play this game with my young Pomeranian mix and it really helps get out his energy and work his mind. We live in a cold climate so we can't spend a lot of time outdoors during winter months. We go outside for short walks with boots and a jacket on him but that lasts 30 minutes and it's BACK inside for all of us.I have had to come up with ingenious ways to give him physical and mental exercise during the 6 months of winter we have here. We use this game and I gradually increase the difficulty. I use the small Pet Botanicals mini training treats for this game. They are tiny, inexpensive, 1/2 calorie each, and he goes nuts over them. I have tried other treats but they do not keep his attention like this brand.When we play this game I set it down while I make him sit and wait and watch. This in itself can be mentally taxing as he gets so excited if I have this game and a bag of treats in my hand. Next, I put the treats (and sometimes food kibble) in the outsides. I generally start by not putting the bone inserts in the middle at first. I only put treats in the outside sliding sections and shutting them. He gets these with no problem. Next, I put treats in all of the areas and insert the white bone inserts. He also gets this pretty quickly although digging the bones out can be tough for him. The last wave is where I don't put anything in the middle bone areas and only use the outsides with empty middles and the white bone inserted. This is difficult because he is only used to digging and moving when there is a treat present. Without a treat present he has to figure out that the bones need to be moved and there won't be a treat behind that bone. It's a lot of fun!",Wonderful Brain Game,5

I have learned to cut them into tinier bites, as she does not really chew them as a dog would.  If small pieces fall off, she either ignores them or doesn't notice, and I want her to get the full benefit. Her teeth are meant for tearing, not chewing, so the \""chews\"" need to be small enough for her to swallow as is.  Their size is my only complaint.

1888,"""M. Downey \""OneKindredSpirit\""""","I have two of these litter boxes.  One located in the bathroom and one in the back room.  The one in the bathroom has the opening toward the wall (the idea being this forces the cats to exit on the side that will catch the most litter - the ribbed top does a pretty good job of getting the granules off their feet).  I've also placed a small litter-catch mat just under the edge of it to the left, because we have tile floor in there and hate to step on litter in our bare feet.  This is the path the cats always take (out of the box and off to the left) so this combination does an excellent job of keeping in the litter contained.In the back room, this box is not against a wall, so I've placed a larger litter-catch mat under the entire box so no matter which exit route they take, the litter is caught and doesn't go on the vinyl flooring.  Both of my cats are 14 lbs and one has a long body so he pokes his head out the opening as he does his business.

1893,"""Terry \""tcinsatx@yahoodotcom\""""","""I have the original Pet Park, which I purchased for my son's old Miniature Pincers. After getting them used to the idea of using it, the Pet Park has been wonderful! They are too old to hold it all day while my son is at work so it keeps my son from finding puddles (and worse) all over the house.I was delighted to be offered a chance to review the Pet Park Deluxe since I often \""babysit\"" my son's little dogs.The Pet Park Deluxe is basically a 3 piece system for dogs to pee and poop on when they can't go outside. It consists of a rigid plastic base which slants slightly to a drain hole in the center. Underneath the drain hole is a plastic drawer. On top of all this is a washable, faux grass mat with a mesh bottom. When your dog urinates on the grass mat, it drains through the mesh base onto the plastic base which funnels down through the drain hole into the drawer below. Poop sits on top of the grass, ready for you to scoop up and dispose of.Maintaining it includes emptying the urine out of the drawer on a daily basis, picking up any poop on top, and hosing off the entire thing at least once a week to avoid odors. It works very well as long as you keep it clean and emptied.Here are a few observations and tips:First, your dog may not know what to do with this initially. The quickest way to get them used to using it is to put a little of your dog's poop on the grass. Sounds gross but it's less gross that finding pee and poop all over your house! Also, watching and rewarding your pooch with a little treat when he/she uses it reinforces the behavior. Be patient, especially if you have an older dog. The effort you put into getting your dog used to using this will pay off handsomely.Second, this is a good sized \""park\"" (25\"" x 20\"") but I think it is most useful for small dogs and puppies. It will fit nicely even on a small patio for those who live in apartments. I can't imagine my lab being able to use it successfully, though.Third, the key to keeping this fresh smelling is to hose it regularly. A pressure washer with some detergent is what we use so the mats always smell fresh, which is important if it will be in your house. Drying the grass mat in the sun really gets rid of odors, but it takes a little while to dry. I would suggest, once you make sure your dog likes using it, buying two or three replacement grass mats for this park. That way you always have a fresh, clean mat.Pet Zoom Pet Park Replacement PadsFourth, if your dog pees a lot or if you have 2 dogs, the drawer with the urine sloshes around a little when you pull it out to empty it. I use a folded up paper towel or chux pad in the bottom of the drawer to minimize sloshing. For dogs who only have trouble holding urine for long periods, aChampion Blue Disposable Underpads (Chux), Small Size 17 x 24, Pk/25fits well directly under the grass mat and is easy to fold up and dispose of. The larger size pads work great, hold more urine, and only hang out a little around the sides.Since my son's dogs are already used to their Pet Park, they have had no problem using this Pet Park Deluxe. Good thing for me since I had them here for the entire Labor Day weekend.If you live in an apartment or are house training a puppy or have an older pet who cannot hold it very long, this product is fantastic.""",A great product but your dog will need to get used to it,5

Even though they aren't big dogs, I'm glad I have the large size biscuit ball, it's a great size for them.  I make homemade gluten-free biscuits for them these days, drying them so they're hard and crunchy and they don't fall apart easily.  Because of this, the homemade biscuits work nicely in the biscuit ball as they're more difficult to get out of the ball compared to store bought biscuits.**Original review**While dog biscuits don't last 5 minutes in this ball with my sheltie, this ball will keep my little boy busy for over half an hour when I fill it with mashed banana or other fruit, yogurt, unsweetened applesauce, or his \""real meals\"", ground meat with veggies, and then freeze it (makes him work harder for the goodies inside).  I then place it either on our enclosed concrete patio that I can hose off, or in his doggie \""playpen\"" out on the lawn, and my little guy goes nuts for it.  Excellent mental stimulation, and much better than him just snarfing up his food in 20 seconds from his food bowl.  We've had this over a year and a half, with no signs of wear.

You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of \""corn meal\"" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.  Time has taught me this.Once you begin to understand that all cat foods are not created equal and where there is \""corn meal\"" filler in the ingredient list (cheap for manufacturers and smelly for the household), you will have more cat waste and more litter to have to scoop and buy.With good foods like Natural Balance (if your cat tolerates it well), you will discover less cat \""poop\"" in the litter box and a LOT less smell around the house.

The pieces are long and threads are at a minimum, I believe due to the hay being housed in a bag in a box, rather than just a bag. There are some brown pieces that my rabbit ignores, but that may just be him being picky. Overall, a great, reliable hay.",Wonderful Hay,5

1948,Amy Rose,"I bought this hoping to have a backup playpen for our new pets. When we rescued a sick kitten (8 wks) from an abandoned house/yard we soon discovered it had Giardia (parasite) and have kept him separate from our other male kitten (12 wks). This pen can also double up as a little den for animals with it's side door. Perhaps for dogs/cats in the yard?The &#34;Small&#34; size pen is comfortable for average cats or puppies but if you have a medium/large animal I'd look for something bigger. Some dogs would make light work of it I'm sure. I'm biased here but it's simply amazing for kittens, especially if they need a &#34;time out&#34; or you're introducing a new cat/kitten to existing pets or just want to keep one safe/secure.  Our 2 kittens play through the pen now so they're off to a good start thanks to this!If you have frolicking puppies or crazy cats - you might find they can mess with it.

1951,Patricia A. Walker,"This arrived yesterday and I immediately began to go to work on a pillow that I have in front of a window...my cats' sunny spot.  I wish I had thought to take a before and after picture of this pillow, but then I realize that I would have been too mortified to ever show anyone how bad that pillow actually was.  There had been a pillow with a flannel pillowcase on it, that I changed to a pillow with regular poly/cotton sham on it.  I figured that poly mix fabric wouldn't be the magnet for hair that the flannel was.  That seemed to be true at first, but it didn't last long.  I used sticky rollers, pet vacs, and ultimately found that huggies naturals wipes, which I have on hand here in my art studio all the time, worked the best for pulling off much of the fur.  But even those would only scratch the surface of the problem.  There was always residual hair that had worked right into the weave of the fabric and wouldn't release.  This brush cleaned that pillow off completely.  It was the most incredible thing I have ever seen.  I took it to the curtains also where one cat in particular likes to deposit her coat.  My art studio is a safe room for her so I can close her up alone when I'm not in here.  Two of my 'original' cats will terrorize her if given the chance.  Unfortunately, this cat is the worst cat for shedding that I have ever seen, and I've known a LOT of cats in my life.  She simply never quits.  My son and I can't figure out how she has a coat left at the rate she sheds it.  She should be bald...go figure.The cats love the thing too.  The soft, but firm, rubber fingers feel really good to them, and they don't get skittish about it like they do with a couple of the other brushes I have, both gentle brushes, not wire ones.  The fact that this brush is narrow means that you don't have a large central area that fur gets trapped and you can't get at it to pull it out.  There is enough space between the 'fingers' that if some hair does stay, running it under the faucet removes it entirely.It is simply the answer that I have been looking for to help control the shedding issues with my four cats.  You will be glad you purchased it.  It also pulled the embedded fur out of my fabric office chair, and from a sheepskin covered memory foam cushion that is now named 'The Princess Pillow'.  It gets covered overnight, so it's a constant cleaning battle with the cushion.  The Huggies did a good job with it, but this does better.  So I am highly pleased with this purchase, which I debated over and over.  I don't think I'm going to even bother to get the cleaning sponge or stone, which were the other two products that I was wavering in my decision regarding which tool to get for my needs.  This one does it and has the dual purpose of being able to brush the cats with it as well. I can't possibly give a stronger recommendation than this.",JUST GET IT! :),5

He will carry a stuffed toy in his mouth wherever he goes, he's not interested in ripping it to shreds.  He will only chew a rawhide or Nylabone for a few minutes before he gets bored.

While I tasted a dog biscuit when I was a kid just to see what our dog&#8217;s excitement was all about, I must confess that I have not yet tasted a Temptation treat to see why our our three cats are so addicted. Their favorite flavor is &#8220;Dairy&#8221; which is very hard to find.

Another one will tear the bag open to get at the treats.Another one of our cats (all rescued shelter felines) had been very ill, dehydrated and disinterested in food when I fostered him from a shelter.

But it's a matter of small percentages, really, and the rest of the product is fine.But the real test is how your dog likes the product.

So, I needed a bigger crate since they both didn't fit in the two small ones I had, and I wanted one that's easy to transport for when we are visiting family and bring the dogs. This fit the bill and was suprisingly affordable. It's good quality and easy to break down and reassemble, plus there's plenty of room inside for two codependent doxies to snuggle. I'd say this size of crate would be appropriate for a dog up to around Border Collie size. You'll need some sort of soft bed/pillow for the bottom of it, since it's not cushioned or anything.

They absorb a large amount of liquid and the Velcro tabs are re-usable, so it is easy to check the diapers. Make sure you fold the tabs back before removing or putting on the diaper; the strong Velcro sticks very well to hair/fur and can be difficult to disengage. The tail hole does NOT prevent feces from leaking out (generally a good thing) but can be taped up for a sick animal. The included wipes are very good and a nice extra. I only wish the diapers were sold in larger quantities for foster parents like me who can have several sick/untrained animals simultaneously.

Chicken is king around here.I reserve these for once in a while treats or to entice eating by sprinkling it atop newly introduced wet/raw foods. The Halo website says the chicken is made in a marinade broth of sodium phosphate, salt, and carrageenan before it's freeze dried. I trust Halo's practices but do wonder how much salt is used in the process and wish the amount was on the label.I also have a tube of Thrive Freeze Dried Chicken from a UK company that has been very popular at holistic pet retailers lately. Their claim is that it's 100% freeze dried chicken and nothing else. I can't garner any more information than that from the tube or the manufacturer website, but my cats go nuts for Thrive just like they do Halo.These are expensive little treats but the cool thing about them is they can be served as solid chunks or broken into dust like particles, or wet by adding a little water.

Once I saw how much my now 4-month old, 40 lbs puppy liked it, I ordered three of these thru the S & S program, based on the rave reviews here.  As per the title of this review, however, I am so disappointed.  Unlike the one from the pet store, these have virtually no available marrow for my puppy to try to eat.  Daily he goes to it, sniffs, licks and bites a little, but within seconds he realizes there is no taste and goes back to try, yet again, the old, empty pet store one, which I imagine still smells like marrow.As many of the reviewers state, this antler is sturdy and doesn't splinter; but in the end, if it has no taste, it is useless.  Unfortunately, the other two look exactly alike.  At least if they had been cut on a diagonal, maybe there would be a little exposed marrow.  I am going to take a friend's suggestion and take the one already opened to a butcher and see if he can cut it so my puppy can get some use out of it.

You (the person) are supposed to use the wand to wave the mouse around on the floor to simulate an actual mouse moving and the cat is supposed to chase and catch it.All three of my cats loved this toy!  My boy cat is a great mouser - he caught it very quickly and actually put it into his mouth and tried to walk away with the entire toy, so proud of his \""catch\"".  Too funny.A few important notes...this is an INTERACTIVE toy, meaning, it is intended to be used during a play session with you and your cat.  Do NOT leave this laying around as a small child could choke on the mouse (it is very hard and small - only about 1 1/2 inches long).  Also, I have a dog and I do not leave it laying around as the dog would definitely choke on this, as well.

But my fat, stubborn, whiny little princess, brat of a cat, decided the floor looked like a better litter box. She pooed on my clothes (her first accident of her life), and then did it again. Her reaction to seeing the hole in the CitiKitty was hilarious though. She acted like it was a portal to hell lol absolutely terrified of it. She would stand with her paws up on the toilet rim and stare into the hole in horror. I touched her back and one point an she about jumped out of her skin. So  :(  So more kitty toilet.

2055,J. M. Black,"Decided to go raw almost a year ago after doing a lot of reading and research.  Started making my own dog meals which was time consuming and always wondering if I had all the right vitamins and minerals included.  I read a review on Paw Naturaw products which come frozen and my dog loved it.  For some reason they were discontinued and I tried Stella and Chewy's.  They are great products, I checked out the nutrition which is perfect and my small Pomeranian (16 lb) loves all the flavors which I rotate with each purchase. Being freeze-dried, they are easier to deliver than the frozen, easier to store and travel with. He doesn't like them re-hydrated, prefers them broken up in his dish dry.  They are a bit spendy; I wouldn't be able to keep a large dog on this diet.  Cisco has about 3-4 of the patties a day supplemented with frozen Nature's Variety Instinct raw.",My dog loves it,5

You can rinse/shake it out in a sink or bowl full of water drained from the aquarium but the cleaned filter will only last 3-4 days before clogging again.  Couple of things to be aware of...a large part of your aquariums ability to remove waste revolves around beneficial bacteria growing in your filter.  When you take the filter out, you remove a lot of organic waste from the ecosystem but you may also remove a lot of the bacteria that are clinging to the filter.As such, when replacing the filter do not clean any other part of the filter assembly.  Do that a week after changing the filter.I also do keep the last \""full\"" filter and after rinsing in drained water I tuck it on top of the filter mechanism under the door so it stays damp.  When I do a water change I use that filter for a few hours after the change to catch all the junk that gets knocked loose in the water, then toss it and use a new one.""",I wish these lasted a little longer but...,4

At our local grocery, Nutrish seems to be the best of the bunch. The other foods are mostly grain, the first ingredient not meat. The first ingredient in this Nutrish formula is chicken with chicken meal following second, and ground rice third.  Following those two is a long list of grains, fillers, and a few token vegetables. I'm not crazy about the corn meal and corn gluten meal high on the list, but the girls haven't complained yet.No, Nutrish doesn't measure up to the so called premium dog foods, but when it's only a third or so of their diet,( two parts Blue and one part Nutrish) I don't think that matters too much.Rachael Ray's Nutrish does meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO, so the girls at least get their daily required levels of vitamins, protein, and fiber.Nutrish is a decent dog kibble, though certainly not in the top tier.

It was a tad unpleasant, but nothing a little airing out couldn't help. It just smelled like hot plastic.The product comes in a small bag with no instructions, and the hammock is broken down into 3 pieces with Velcro strips attached. The size was good for my tiny Scion tc, and if I could install it in a 2-door car, I'm assuming it would be even easier in a 4-door. The Velcro held together extremely well. The cover also protected my seats from claw marks, muddy paws, and even fur.Please keep in mind that this product is not 100% guaranteed to keep your pet safe. Many times, my Keeshond made it into the front seat by just jumping over the front portion, and she did manage to get herself stuck under the hammock once or twice. I would suggest pairing this with a seatbelt harness, to keep your dog in one place while you drive. With how cheap this hammock is, an extra safety measure shouldn't break the bank.","Slight smell, but does the job",4

2123,Mercedes J.,"I got this hoping to correct some slight behavioral issues with my 8 month old American Eskimo (minimal barking, jumping, and chewing one particular piece of furniture). It did not work one bit. It's not very user friendly, and instead of being annoyed by the noise, he was more curious. The most I ever got when pushing the button was an alert head-tilt to the side.To operate the remote you press the power/mode button on the left. Press once and you're on the manual setting (a little red light blinks every 5 seconds next to the word 'power'). Press twice and you're on the auto setting (a little red light alternates blinking next to both the 'power' and the 'auto' words). The first annoying issue is that the little red light doesn't stay on, so you have to stare at it for a few seconds to determine what setting you're in. Why they couldn't just have the light stay on is beyond me.The next annoyance is programming. To program the remote you must first be in Auto mode, then you press the Frequency Selector button on the right. At this point three red lights blink back and fourth while five different tones are set off, one at a time. You're supposed to (while your dog is lying down and not paying attention to you) cycle through the five tones and then press the Manual button once you see your dog respond to one. The only problem was my dog didn't respond to any of them negatively. He would look up and turn his head, then lay back down, and even that was only from one tone.When I tried this in Auto mode, it barely worked. I set it by the front door, went into another room, and had my son go out front and ring the doorbell. The dog would bark, stop for a second to look at the hall table, bark again, stop and look at the table, bark again, and so on. So this didn't stop him from barking completely, it just made him pause.Overall, I absolutely would NOT recommend this to anyone. I wasn't expecting much when I picked it, but since it was free, I figured there was nothing to lose. If I had purchased this it would absolutely be going right back to Amazon for a refund. I realize all dogs are different, and this MAY work for you, but I wouldn't count on it. Mine is headed for the trash can.",Awkward and Useless...,1

2169,"""Mark M. Stevens \""Mark Stevens\""""","Based on other reviews I snapped these up with high hopes. My Bearded Collie gets horrible snow balls in his furry paws and he's not real keen on the idea of wearing boots. The price of the boots is very attractive, but please consider these things before you buy:1. you MUST have two people to put them on. I don't care that they look like balloons like some of the other negative reviews say. They could look like duck feet if they worked. the problem is that putting them on is like putting balloons on. you must have one person to hold the dog's foot/leg (and in our case whole dog) and another to stretch these on. If you've got a shaggy dog like me it's that much harder.We have two people, so no big loss, but know it's not a one person job.2. the single best tip I read was to put them on and head right out on the walk. On the plus side for these boots compared to others I will say that my dog didn't like having them put on, but he made no protest once they were on. I believe getting right outside to the snow helps that.3. the boots do nothing to insulate. we weren't expecting that, they're thin rubber, you shouldn't expect it either. they're for keeping stuff off your dog's feet. It was 1 degree here yesterday and his feet got cold as fast with the boots as without.The biggest complaint about the boots is durability. Several people said that the boots last and I just haven't found that. We live two blocks from a park. in the time it takes to walk 2 blocks, play on snow covered grass for 20 min and walk back the boots are shredded. I wasn't expecting these things to last forever, but certainly more than 20 min. Our dog is 3 and his running and jumping on a pretty soft and forgiving surface just tore up the boots. I can't imagine walking on non snow covered sidewalk.so if you have a senior dog with nice dull nails these might be ok. for a 3 year old active dog they're a sad disappointment.","so hopeful, so disappointed",2

2171,LBDW,"I passed over Da Bird Cat Toy several times because the photo image of the toy made it seem like it might be too simple for my cat and I wasn't sure it would interest her. Finally I decided to give it a try based on all the great reviews and the enticing price.From the moment I started playing with my cat Misty, I could see what all the fuss was about!  I have had this toy for only two days and it stimulates and exercises my cat like no other toy.  Do not be deceived by its simple look like I was.  When I first swung the toy around for Misty, I was really impressed how the feathers flutter in the air and by the fluttering sound it produces. Misty went absolutely nuts! She was leaping and jumping all over the place to capture &#34;Da Bird&#34;.  She loves it so much that when she gets a hold of it, she sometimes tries to run away with her &#34;captured prey&#34; and doesn't want to let go right away.Misty is highly intelligent so she tends to figure out toys rather quickly, even the laser pointer bores her at times.  However, based on her initial reaction the last two days, I don't foresee boredom with this toy.My tips when using Da Bird:1.) It is definitely a supervised play time toy.  If left unsupervised the feathers will mostly be destroyed quite quickly.2.) If your cat is smart like mine, do not let your cat see where you store the toy.  I made that mistake the first night, and the next day my cat was scratching like crazy at my Ikea cabinet that I stored it in try to get to her new toy, She has never reacted this way about a toy! It was absolutely hysterical and made for a great video to share with my family!.  Needless to say though, nobody needs their cat scratching at their furniture.Drawbacks:1.) If my cat tugs really hard at the feathers the 2 piece pole comes apart, but I just have to put it back together. I may just end up tapping it together at some point to avoid that.2.) I can tell that she will end up wearing out the feathers pretty regularly, so I will need to have refills on hand.However, these two small drawbacks are completely outweighed by the excitement and exercise it provides for my cat. So I can easily give this 5 stars and I will be getting refills and sticking with this product long term.",Not to be Overlooked! Suprisingly Amazing!

The first time I walked him with it I wished I had purchased the more expensive option (which is why I'm back on Amazon today). The links are twisted wrong and pop apart. If I were training a dog who had issues, they could have easily run away. As it was, I just had to catch my dog and was lucky there was no traffic. I've tried several times to correct the angle on the links without any sustained luck. When it stays together, his walking and pulling issues are corrected, but then it will randomly pop loose again and I've given up on being able to use it.

2190,"""E. Gamez \""Cheddar323\""""","""I've been using Prime for quite a while now and it seems to be working out for me. When I first started out with my tanks I was using \""Jungle\"" water conditioner and it seemed to do it's job but I wanted something more \""top of the line\"" if you will. I didn't make the switch because I thought the \""Jungle\"" product was inferior but I just wanted the \""best\"" for my fish. I started researching about the best water conditioner and everyone kept raving about \""Prime\"" they would talk about how affordable it was and the benefits that came from using this product. It seemed like the best choice for me so I made the switch I did notice that the stuff is very strong and concentrated so it doesn't take much to treat your water. As far as dosing Prime you just need to follow the instructions on the back of the bottle. I'm usually careful when I dose with Prime because of it's potency so when I prepare my water in a 5 gallon bucket I usually dose 2 drops per gallon. The reason I do it this way is because I don't want to overdose on Prime I rather be safe than sorry. With that said when I first started dosing with Prime I would dose it straight into the bucket of water. Then I would siphon the water into my tank without letting the water age. I started noticing that every time after I did a water change my fish would start gulping for air at the surface. I started reading certain threads and some people stated that in some cases too much Prime can cause oxygen depletion. Seachem has stated that you can overdose Prime about 5x the recommended dosage and it still would be safe for fish. I personally wouldn't take the risk especially if you don't have proper aeration in your tank. I know most people will say that it doesn't matter if you let your water age or if you wait for the water conditioner to take effect (since it works instantly) and they might be right but in my situation it seems to make a difference. I let my water age for about 24 hours and I sometimes even dose the water before letting it age. I also give the water a little stir just to make sure everything is mixed up well I'm not sure if it helps but I do it regardless. I've noticed that after doing all of the above my fish don't gasp for air anymore and they don't seem to be bothered at all by weekly water changes. The only downside to my method would be that the agents that lock down ammonia, nitrites and nitrates to something less toxic wouldn't really be taking effect. These locking agents stop working after 24 hours or 48 hours depending on how much you dose. I'm not too worried about it though because I keep my tanks fairly clean and I methodically keep up with my water changes. Be warned that Prime does not get rid of ammonia, nitrites or nitrates for good it just converts it to something less toxic which then allows your biological filtration to clean it up for a short period of time. Like I stated before Prime only takes effect for a brief moment and once it stops working the toxins that were locked down are released back into your water. That's where regular water changes come into play having clean water and using Prime in conjunction will definitely work to your advantage. I would say that in laymen terms Prime is a good water dechlorinator that happens to come with a few extra's. Would I say it's worth making the switch? I wouldn't really be able to answer that question because there are a lot of great products out in the market that work similar if not the same as Prime. I would however say that from a personal stand point Prime is a great product and it works very well and if used correctly it can be very effective and affordable at the same time.""",Seachem Prime,5

I have 2 dogs - one extremely smart and one not too bright.  The not to bright dog is a 25lb beagle/rotweiler mix and is the barker of the 2.  I put the collar on and she ran outside to bark and immediately got sprayed - it stopped her in her tracks.  Cease fire - no more barking.  Well the collar only holds about 4-5 sprays before it's empty.  After being outside for an hour or so and some half attempts to bark which caused the spray to go off - she realized the collar stopped spraying and then it was full throttle barking.  I refilled it and she stayed quiet for a short time but eventually figured out that if she runs and barks the spray just blows by her and eventually runs out.  Now it really doesn't work on her at all.  She's immune to the citronella.  My smart dog on the other hand (a 30lb beagle/border collie mix) realizes the spray is annoying and only barks once before stopping.  She'll still test it from time to time (and I'm better about keeping it filled), but for the most part it works about 75% of the time on keeping her quiet.  I ended up buying the PetSafe No-Bark Collar and am testing it out on the crazy barker.  I'll write a review once I've given it a test run.

2253,J L W,"""Please read this. This is not a ding against this product, only advise on the delivery system of it to your pet.  I have a wire haired terrier.  I was told by my vet to go on here and get this for her for liver problems.  I got the med size tabs for 13 pounds to 34 pounds, since the normal weight of my dog is 13.5 to 14.5.  There are very specific directions to follow when administering these tablets that must be followed, or the tabs will be useless.  The pills must be given with no food or at the most a tiny bite of food.  You are not suppose to break them up and give part of it later, as the contents are rendered useless if exposed to air for more than a minute or two.  This size pill is about 3/4\"" long and 1/4 wide.  (No way was I going to get this tab in one piece down my little dogs throat without choking her.  I ended up cutting the pill in pieces with a pill cutter then crushing it to a powder with a rolling pin and making a little pocket out of some soft dog food (a small as possible piece of food)  and putting the powder inside, then pushing that down her throat, as she is not willing to eat much at this time.  Now I called the Nutramax people themselves and talked with a rep who said what I did was ok, just as long as the amount of food was tiny, as it needs to be given on an empty stomach.  I concluded after all this that I should have gotten the pills for cats and small dogs, even though the weight is less than my dog.  They are 1/4\"" in dia, according to Nutramax rep I talked to, and round.  90 milligrams so I will need to give 2-3 tabs a day instead of the one horse pill,  but this will enable me to not break them open.  And a smaller amount of food will be needed to wrap around the pill, thus being closer to the recommended dosing procedure.  Live and learn.Also, as all other reviewers have stated, there is a huge price difference between vet and amazon on these over the counter pills.  I got mine from amazon with prime membership I got free shipping and free 2 day delivery.  And I live way out in the middle of nowhere and still got them two days later from UPS.  Way to go amazon.  I cannot speak to the effectiveness of this product as of yet, as this is only her second day on it.  I am hoping for a good result, as she is not eating hardly any food at all, she is very lethargic and doesn't have much interest in eating or drinking at all.  Her liver levels are very high and her pancreatitus has flared up again.

I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:\""Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients.

He frequently scratches at his ears, and occasionally they develope a bad odor. Frequent ear wash treatments seem to help alleviate his symptoms. However this product in particular is awful. It is not very effective, and our dog hates it. When we used it he would cry and attempt to twist away. The wash contains alcohol, and thus can be painful and irritating, especially if your pet has been scratching his ears. I know that it says that it contains aloe vera, which may make you think that it is a soothing product, but all of the other ingredients are incredibly irritating-sd alcohol 40-2 10%, lactic acid 1.76% benzoic acid .15%, dioctyl sodium, sulfosuccinate, salicylic acid.

2308,"""crazyoaks \""crazyoaks\""""","I wanted this to see if I could keep dogs and goats out of a garden area.  This is a sprinkler that mounts on a sensor.  The hose connects to the sensor.  A stake that you can push down with your foot holds it all into the ground.  There is a plastic wrench included to help you tighten the sprinkler to the sensor.  You will need four AA batteries to make the unit work.  You can set the sensitivity from one to nine and set the sprinkler to cover a specific area so that it will cover a small corner or go all the way around. You can also set it so that it will spray more toward the ground or higher.  In theory when something moves in front of the sensor the sprinkler will spray water at the intruder and this will keep them or it away from the area.One of the first things I noticed is that the unit needed a way to turn it off.  There may be a time that you don't need the unit on and the only way to turn it off is to take the batteries out and that is cumbersome.  One thing to think about when using this are the many cities, even rural towns that are now enforcing water restrictions.  So if you can only water on certain days what happens if someone sees that your Spray Away is going off and thinks you are watering?  I am not sure and you might want to check into that if you live in an area where you have water restrictions.  That is just one reason they need some way to turn it off other than taking out the batteries.My dog is a Brittany and she is fast and hyper.  So by the time she ran through the garden and the Spray Away sensor figured out that it needed to spray, even on the most sensitive setting, she was gone.  My daughter's dog is a Labrador/Chesapeake Retriever who loves water.  He thought the water spray was great fun!  The goats don't like the water, but they haven't yet figured out what makes the water spray.  They really like checking out the garden, but it may still work for keeping them away.  If I set it high enough to keep out the goats, then it won't keep out small animals like raccoons, armadillos, or the free-range chickens.  Yes, a fence is in the works, but even with a fence the smaller animals will still be able to get in as they do in the already fenced yard area.So did I like it and would I use it again?  As it was it did cut down on the amount of watering that I had to do so that was a help in the heat.  That might change over time.  I think that more than one would be required for the kinds of animals and the purpose that I wanted it to serve.  I don't believe that it would completely keep away all the small or large animals just by using the Spray Away alone, but I certainly believe that using it in conjunction with other things like fencing, strategic placement and aim would be a humane way to solve many of your frustrating outdoor animal problems.  However, the most fun was for my daughter's dog, who gets hot in our area and loves his new water toy.",It has other uses,3

2312,Jaw,"""I had a bad flea problem last year after getting a puppy. this year, i managed it by getting a new dyson vacuum cleaner, vacuuming very frequently (vacuum cleaner very easy to use) and giving my dog Revolution and Capstar. But after the bad experience last year, i wanted to be protected so i decided to have Fleabusters come out to put their boric acid dust in my carpet, hoping i wouldn't have to give any more revolution and Capstar.  But by the time they came out, i didnt' have any fleas. I do believe it works, buti can't base this on my experience because they were already gone.Fleabusters sent a man to apply the dust.  Before he started, he held a canister in his hands, not the can with the dust in it but a long narrow one that got smaller at each end, and seeing me staring at it, he said \""This is a liquid i'm going to spray under your beds, in your bathrooms and on your furniture.\""  I asked what it was and he said pyrethrins. I wasn't sure what that was but i assumed it was part of their process.It took about an hour for him to spray the liquid and spread the dust.  I waited outside, watching him through the sliding glass door.  When i came back in, he gave me a copy of the invoice, $225, which had a guarantee on it that was different from the guaranty on their website, although i didn't notice it at the time. On the website it says if you're not satisfied for any reason, you can have a refund, unconditional. On the paper they gave me, it said if you're not satisfied, they reserve the right to retreat your place before considering a refund.That afternoon, i developed a burning sensation in my upper respiratory tract.  There was fine white dust all over everything.  I was told i could vacuum the next day. I figured this would clear up.  I vacuumed the next day. The irritation continued. It was a mild irritation. I didn't like it but i figured with all that dust in the air, it was just something that would happen and it would go away.Two weeks later, i still had the mild burning sensation.  It wasn't bad but it worried me. I called the company that had come out to my house.  i left a message. My call was not returned. I called again the second day and spoke to the owner on the phone.  He said that it would go way soon, \""we see this some times,\"" he said some people are allergic, but i don't think it was an allergy.  I don't have any allergies and i dont' have any chemical sensitivities, i'm healthy, i haven't missed a day of work in at least 10 years, i don't get colds or i get over them really fast, no coughs, etc.  but this burning sensation just didn't get any better.I asked him why pyrethrins had been used when it didn't say anything about that on their website or when you call on the phone. He said there was no possible way the man used pyrethrins, he said the man must've must mispoke when he told me that, must've been distracted and had a lot on his mind.  this wasn't very reassuring to me, since the man looked right at me and said pyrethrins.But i wasn't really worried about pyrethrins because i had looked them up on the web and it said they break down rapidly in heat and light and air so i figured they weren't there anymore, and i figured it was just the boric acid dust, which kept coming up into my vacuum cleaner canister in great amounts. i was surprised it didn't decrease.I asked if cleaning my carpet would help and he emphatically said yes, and he said that although on my guarantee it says that washing the carpet would void my warranty, this was incorrect, washing the carpete would not make the product ineffective and would not void the warranty. He then put it in writing and faxed it to me.  I had the carpet washed that day, but unfortunately, the burning sensation continued.After a couple of weeks i called him again to ask for help in finding out information about what i should do and how to remove this product.  My call was not returned. I called each day.  Nice pleasant people took my messages and said they were sorry my call hadn't been returned. I left voice mails. Then, i called the company that makes this product, not the guy who applied it but the main company, and left a voice mail asking someone to call me and give me more information about the product and how to get it so it was no longer getting stirred up into my air.  My call was not returned, so i emailed them.  I got an email reply saying they had forwarded my email to the guy who was not returning my calls, as i had already told them.  I emailed them again and asked for the guy's email which they gave me and i emailed him, asking for more information about removing the product or somehow getting it out of the air.  He didn't reply.  His wife did reply to one of my voice mails and left me a message saying that he recommended that i get a respirator mask and use it while vacuuming and that that would help.  it didn't help.I now know the respirator mask didn't help because you can't take it off. After you vacuum you should keep it on, i didnt' know this but i know now more than i ever wanted to about boric acid, fine dust, pyrethrins, permethrin, and their hazards.  Fleabusters boasts on their website that this is an extremely finely milled dust, they refer to it as microscopic.  dust that fine does not quickly settle down after it's been stirred up, it stays in the air for hours or more.  if those dust particles are impregnated with offgassing pyrethrins, then that is what is being breathed deeply into the lungs.  The body can't get this out.  it's so fine, it penetrates deeply and may not cause symptoms immediately but can impair respiration later in life.I saw my doctor and she said i had chemical irritant pneumonitis from boric acid. She said it's not an allergy, it's caused by a chemical in the atmosphere like happened in New York after 911. She said the only thing i could do for this was to not go into the place where i was being exposed.  But it was my home. i have a job, etc. a life.  she said the only other way of not being exposed would be to wear a respirator 24/7.  You can't really do that though, those respirators are not made to be worn all the time, you'd be changing the filters frequently. you couldn't eat.  those things are not comfortable.The Fleabusters company was not helpful, they were quite uncaring.  I reported this to the county agency that handles things like this. They interviewed the man who came out to my house and he told them he did not spray any liquid in my house.  That was that, there was nothing more the county could do.I learned that to have my home air or dust tested for pyrethrins, boric acid, and permethrins (which the owner said the man might've used) would cost me at least over $1000. I was also told i need to get rid of my beds and my upholstered furniture because pyrethhrins won't come out of that. I learned that while pyrethrins break down rapidly in light and heat, they wil not break down if they're under my bed where it's dark and cool, but they will offgass (a word i learned while trying to solve the problem that since Fleabusters came, my home isn't safe to breathe in anymore) and the offgassing will impregnate dust particles and be breathed into the air.The Fleabusters owner did talk to me one more time on the phone and said it was impossible that his product could still be causing symptoms  over a month later.  He said he wanted to help me find out what the problem was and that he could easily come out and test my air.  By that time, after him not returning my calls for 2 weeks before this phone call, i had called them and asked for a refund. Their website does say after all, if you are not satisfied for any reason, you may have a refund. By this time, i  had spent about $500 trying to stop the exposure of whatever they put in there, carpet cleaning, respirator masks, 6 window fans, had missed work, used up vacation time, had suffered burning my lungs, and was definitely not satisfied. but when i got him on the phone, he said he didn't think a refund was appropriate because 'we haven't done anything wrong.'He said he just cared about finding out what was causing my problem and could easily come out and test my air, in order to find out.  I said i would really appreciate that.  I already knew at that point that it would cost me a thousand dollars to have it done.  He said he would get back to me in two days.  He never got back to me so i disputed the charge on my visa card. That dispute is still pending.This is a terrible company. I do think the product probably works, but i didn't have fleas before they came so i can't say.  There is no technical expertise to help a consumer if there is a problem with the product.  There is no communication.  it's very hard to reach them, impossible to reach the main company in Florida, they would not talk to me at all, period, after i had asked them to provide me with the best information about what might be happening in my home, since they have the scientists that have developed the stuff.Before i had them come out, i looked on the web for user reviews, to make sure it was safe.  I  found positive reviews about it working well. Only one person said it made her sneeze so much that she had to have her son apply it, she couldn't do it.  So, i thought it sounded pretty safe.I recently found a website called Only Natural Pet Store that has about 20 user reviews on Fleabusters.  Most are positive like these here.  But quite a few mention that the product causes irritation. I wish i'd read that before i had them come out.I finally had to move out of my place, i haven't been staying there for a month and a half. I'm still paying the rent there.  Whenever i go over there to get stuff, i get the irritation.  Something is wrong with the air there, something Fleabusters put into my home.  Before i moved out in mid october, back in late September, i went out of town for three days, and had no symptoms the whole time, but it started again within an hour after i got back.  When i moved out, the symtpoms stopped, unless i go over there. i dont' know what they put in, and they won't help me to find out. maybe it's the boric acid dust, maybe it's the pyrethrins the guy claimed he was spraying and later denied, maybe it's Precor with permethrin which the owner told the air testing guy i was consulting with might have been used.  i don't know.  i dont' know if i really have to throw away my much loved beds and sofa and love seat and other furniture, the curtains, get rid of the carpets, i dont know. i hate to do that without first finding out what's in there.  to have my life torn apart to this extent and not know what's causing it, i can't make peace with that, yet it costs so much to have it tested, i have to think about it some more.i've learned that the Borax company who makes boric acid powder does not list the broadcast method as one of the recommended applications of boric acid. They only recommend putting it in areas like cracks and crevices, not where there is traffic by people and animals that might stir it up.  It's not meant to be breathed and they don't list spreading it all over the environment as one of the recommended applications.I would say if you have a family member, a child or a pet, anyone who is sensitive to dust or has any respiratory issues, think carefully before using this product. As the company says on its website, the dust is milled extremely fine.  That is the most dangerous kind of dust exposure there is, and long term problems can be caused by it even if there is no problem in the short run.  Again, i have no allergies, no chemical sensitivities, no illnesses, and all i have is a mild burning sensation in my upper respiratory tract if i'm around my home, beginning the day that fleabusters came. It may be that they sent an unqualified unprofessional unethical guy to my home to apply the dust and he sprayed something in there that he wasn't supposed to. But when i told the company about what the man said he was spraying, they just dismissed it rather than taking it seriously, it's not that the  guy questioned that this man would have really sprayed something--he said \""He must've sprayed liquid sodium polyborate, the same as the dust. there's no way he sprayed pyrethrins\""  why would i make that up?  he didn't question that i was making it up.  He just didn't care. or didn't want to deal with it, didn't want to be responsible for the man he sent into my home.i wish i never had Fleabusters come to my house.  it was a terrible mistake.""",Be careful,1

Loud noises such as the ball makes when it whirls around, jar him and the size of the ball may also be a bit too big and heavy for him until he gets a bit bigger.

2362,C.

No stomach discomfort at all, nor have I had a taste or smell of the product in the minutes after I take it.  I do only take one soft gel per day in the morning, breakfast or not.2.  I love the fact that the soft gels are dark, and the bottle is dark, so I know that the ingredients are protected from light as much as possible.3.  I don't find the softgels hard to take at all, but I've been taking fish oil for years and years, and I am used to really big softgels.  I do not like to take large powdery tablets, so I think it is the gel part that makes it easy.4.  I am tickled to find a product that contains turmeric, which has been clinically proven around the world to have significant benefits. I have taken tumeric for several years now, so finding this product is exciting, and helps me cut down on supplements.Bottom line:  I took tumeric and fish oil for years.

It seems to go further this way than letting it glide, and longer throws means less throwing for my Golden retriever pup!  I figured a toy designed to be thrown this way would be even better, but I was completely wrong.  I picked up the large size and it's very wide, like maybe 2.5-3 inches.  I have medium to large sized hands but the wide profile makes it awkward for me the throw effectively.  It also starts to hurt my fingers after about 10 minutes from friction, and this is coming from somebody who works with his hands enough to have many callouses.  It also doesn't roll very far.  I've got a 1.5 acre yard so maybe I was expecting this to cover too much of it, but the Chuckit Frisbee and Flying Squirrel both fly and/or roll for a long distance, so I expected a wheel toy to do the same.  I can probably get 50% of the distance out of this that I can with those 2, and that's with much more effort coming from me.  So this is a huge disappointment with me from this company.  I'll add that the other 3 products I've purchased from this brand I'm very happy with (squirrel, frisbee, and kickball).

It is well worth the money. Raid, and other store bought products do not work. I used to use Demize Nylar spray, which is also an excellent product with IGR, but they discontinued it. I ordered this instead and I have only good things to say about it. It is just as effective at killing fleas and keeping them away, but is even less noxious than the demize spray. it smells kind of like wd-40. I am not sure why, but I will take that over the peppery type smell that the demize had. It dries nice, doesn't stain anything, doesn't leave terrible odors behind, and I would say it is relatively cheap for the flea fighting power you are getting. Anyone that has dealt with flea infestations knows it is worth almost any amount of money to get rid of them. The Precor is reasonable in price for the results.I usually get a case of 6 at a time and spray my house down in fall and spring each year. The IGR prevents flea eggs from hatching and gives 7 month coverage so it is worth it to me to do the whole house twice a year. then I never have to worry about a stray flea laying a million eggs at some point and my house getting infested again. It only kills adult fleas for 2 weeks, but if you see a flea here and there during the year, that is all you will see. Nothing will come of it if you keep your house treated. the spray doesn't bother the cats or the kids and I have seen no ill effects from using it. I lock the cats outside and spray while the kids are in school. Once the spray dries, you don't even know it is there. I am very sensitive to chemicals like bleach and febreze, as well as paint fumes, furniture polish, and things like that, and I never have sinus or respiratory issues after I use this product.So take it from a long term user of this and similar products, you can't go wrong with a flea spray with IGR in it. you will never go back.

Before starting these she had a hairball about 1-2 times a week.I think it's important to note that my cat is on a special diet due to food sensitivities and issues with dry food.  She exclusively eatsNatural Balance Canned Cat Food, Limited Ingredient Duck and Green Pea Recipe, 24 x 6 Ounce Pack, one can per day.  Before switching food she was puking on a daily basis, mostly undigested food.  She also could not tolerate treats, namely pounce.  I was nervous to give these furball plus treats to her, thinking that she might have trouble with even them.  This is not the case, as she seems to digest them just fine.Time will tell if these work long-term, and since the bag is only 60 treats, at 2-4 a day you only get 15 or 30 days worth, respectively.  I'm already spending $45 per month on her canned food, but if these continue to prevent hairballs they are worth it.I will update in a couple of months when I have a measurable improvement or lack of.

The last time we brought home some tennis balls as soon as the novelty of \""new toys\"" had warn off he had all of them stripped of their fuzz within a few hours.  It would have taken less time but he likes to... savor their demise one felt strip at a time before he smashes them between his back teeth.  We bought this (size M) thinking it would stand up to his chewing and be harder for him to destroy since there is no outer material he can remove, plus we were interested in the erratic bounce factor.Our house is small and we keep him out of the bedrooms so he's left with an oddly shaped 250 sq feet (including furniture & kitchen) in which to play.  This can make fetch a bit boring but this ball does a nice job of keeping him guessing as to where it's going to go.  Sometimes when we use it outside it bounces just like a regular ball but there's enough variation that he's always on his toes.  The two holes let us put a few treats inside and, unlike his kong, he can actually fit the whole thing in his mouth to chew on.  I can't say for sure since I can't read his mind, but I think he likes the unusual shape and texture compared to regular round balls.  The only way he would love this ball more is if it squeaked, but honestly I'm grateful that it doesn't.""",Keeps fetch interesting,5

2398,"""Campbell Welsh \""Campbell\""""","I've just read reviews (the negative ones) that their dog bent and/or broke parts of the crate.  One even caused injury with photos of blood on the floor!  Bottom line, a crate will not cure crate anxiety.  Training is what cures crate anxiety.  If you have a dog like this - reach out to local dog training organizations who can help you train your dog to enjoy their crate.Just a few tips are: fix up the crate, put a favorite toy inside, and keep door open.... place the food bowl in crate - leave door open so dog must go inside to eat.  Be sure NOT to close the door on the dog...let them get used to eating inside the crate.  If, at any time inbetween feeding the dog wanders into the crate for any reason - click and treat.  If the dog refuses to go in the crate to eat, then the dog goes hungry.  Eventually, the dog will decide it is worth the risk to enter the crate to get to the food.  When the door does NOT close behind it, eventually, anxiety will lower.Take time training your dog that a crate is a nice safe place.  If the dog gets to the point to allow you to close the door (after much positive inforcement and time), shut the door for 5 minutes, then 10 minutes, etc.I've just ordered this crate for my dog.  She has crate anxiety and during times of stress or boredom, she is more than capable of bending thin wire just for fun.  It may take some time before I can get her to remain in the crate overnight.  Also - never expect a high drive dog to be crated for long periods of time.  If crated overnight to only be let out for morning potty and feeding - to be placed back in the crate for another 8 or 9 hrs, try to come up with an alternative set-up - at least for one of those periods. 16 to 20 hours a day is a lot to ask your dog to tolerate inside a crate.",Crate Anxiety Can Not Be Cured by a Crate,5

We also had to buy some more wire because it didn't come with quite enough. My poor Beagle got completely freaked out the first time she got shocked and refused to go in the yard for a couple days. She slowly started to venture out, but it took her a couple weeks to go out on her own. Even after showing her the boundaries, leaving up the flags, etc., she still hasn't fully figured out how it works. But at least she is going in the yard again, so it is worth it. We bought a house on a beautiful lake and didn't want to ruin our view with a fence. I feel a little bad about doing this to her since she used to be much more happy go lucky outside, but I am hoping with more time, she will relax. She has run through the boundary a couple times. She either runs back through it and into the house to cower, or runs to the front stoop to cower until someone lets her in. Everything seems to work fine. We keep the shock on a very low setting. The collar doesn't bother her either. I take it off every night, but she wears it all day and doesn't seem to notice it. It was also way cheaper than a real fence, which is probably my favorite thing about it.","So far, so good",5

Under the \""hood\"" this fountain has TOO MANY (unnecessary?) tight corners that harbor uncleanable areas.  The best way I found to really clean the PetMate fountain was to remove the pump and submerge the parts in a pail containing a diluted bleach solution.  While effective, it was time consuming and even with the most thorough of rinsing, my cat found the odor to be objectionable for the first 24 (+/-) hours.  The little water reservoir is like filling an old fashioned water cooler - invert it quickly and hope for as little spillage as possible.  I always seemed to end up soaking up a couple of paper towels getting the area dry enough for my cat's tootsies.  With only one cat using it, I gave up and donated it to my local shelter for their rummage sale.FWIW, I substituted one of those clear, plexi, three liter \""beta\"" aquariums you can find at the pet store that comes with its own little power filter.  There isn't any need for gravel or plastic plants, just the bare bones tank/bowl and the power filter which has it's own easily changable carbon & floss cartridges that keeps the water fresh and clean.  The water fall design of the power filter oxygenates the water and it has enough of a flow to keep my spoiled Maine Coon Cat happy.  The smooth sides of the four sided tank/bowl quickly wipes clean.

I begin the review with this point because I want it clear that (1) my cats are used to getting treats and (2) I do not give them too many. They've had Temptations before, and they'll eat it, but they won't devour it. In other words, they leave some behind. (Eventually, they do finish it, though.) The last time I gave them Temptations, though, I had several instances of throwing up. I don't know whether it was one cat or more than one since I never witnessed the event. I thought perhaps I'd bought a couple bags from a bad batch.So when this product was available through the Amazon Vine program, I thought I'd give Temptations a chance at redemption.

I really have not seen a huge difference in her behavior. She is not aggressive, though she does show a little aggression towards my Sharpei when he gets too close to her bed.

As far as storms, go I cannot vouch for this product as my dogs mostly do not care when there are storms or fireworks.I decided to give this a try with my smaller 45lb Sharpei. While he is usually a cute and cuddly guy, he turns into Cujo (well, he starts to growl, anyway) after he steals the Doberman's rawhide. We gave him one of these, which he gleefully chewed up. Checked on him 30 minutes later (still with the stolen rawhide) and he growled as usual, same after we went to bug him an hour later. Gave him another one the next day and it still did nothing to calm him in any way.We tried again on a day our Doberman had to go to the vet. She was still nervous and peed herself on the way home.Not to say this is an overall bad product, but it did not do much for my dogs, except that they liked the taste.  They also had no adverse reactions to it, although if your pet needs to be 100% gluten free, you might want to pass on this.

I'd estimate the build-up is reduced by half. This isn't a scientific study, just one dog lover's experience, and the amount of tartar I was attacking was small.

Turns out we were right, the size is perfect for her cats and keeps them on schedule no matter what. They also took to it very quickly within about a day.Overall it really depends on a few things; the size of your pet, your pets self control( like eats a huge bucket of food in one sitting when its meant to last all weekend) or need for consistent feedings.

2597,Peter Suslock,"Having been keeping and breeding fish for close to 40 years, there are few products I've found that actually deliver on the promise made to the consumer. Marineland does have some excellent products especially their line of LED lighting - however their filters have always left much to be desired. Both The H.O.T and Magnum series have received horrible reviews year after year. That said the C series has been touted as an excellent filter with zero water bypass.First, few filters with exception of the eheim Pro series prevent most any water bypass - no filter can operate without a marginal degree of bypass but this isn't an issue in small amounts - and again unavoidable.What I found most troubling about the filters (I had purchased two of these) was the poor build quality especially with the quick release port. There is absolutely no metal and the on/off switch beneath the locking mechanism is frail to say the least an quite easy to break leaving with no way to remove your intake and out take port without a flood. The concept for these ports was designed by Gunther eheim - a maverick and pioneer in aquatic filtration. Because they're the one part of the filter that takes the most abuse they should be build like iron and made to last.Although I have been an eheim advocate for decades - I run a 2080, XL100 and a couple of Pro 3e's and four smaller 2078 units. I've been looking for a less expensive alternative especially for single specimen tanks. However after trying so many different brands - I find the old adage is true - you get what you pay for.That said I have found success with the Aquatop - ironically made by SunSun who on their high end makes excellent filters although few are sold in the US. Because the Marineland C series is identical inmost every way from the moldings, clamp design and basket design my guess is these are private label for Marineland. This isn't a complaint private label manufacturing is nothing new and often affords the consumer to get the same quality for less.At the end of the day what's really going to make your filter pay off in regards to the overall health of your fish is the media you use. Both Fluval and eheim make extraordinary media that promotes fast and efficient growth of nitrifying bacteria. Should you choose this filter my advice would be to discard the media and invest in unfinished ceramic and slintered glass spheres - they last forever.Activated carbon should NEVER be used for more than two weeks as it turns toxic. It's best use by far is in removing trace medications and toxins - and again for short periods of time not to exceed two weeks. For Marineland to claim that media should be washed every week and replaced every nine weeks boggles my mind as this claim goes against the very principles mandatory for establishing a fully cycled tank and healthy and stable  water parameters.The thinking here of course is to sell more media and to sell it on an on going basis. Like printers there is no real revenue in the sale of machine itself - the profit is in the ink. Same concept here.",Poor Build Quality Ineffiecent Line of Filters,2

I've been in that situation before where my previous owners didn't take as good care of me and boy did my hair look like a teenanger's at a 60's high school dance. So as the brush arrived, I was skeptical because 1. it smelled like a new product and 2. it was spikey. I sniffed it for a couple of minutes until I gave the green light to use this thing on me. The side with the larger bristles was used first because I think it helps gets my fur straightened first before it goes through the more fine bristled side.OH MAN did this thing feel good. As soon as the brushing began, I couldn't help but lie on my side and have a huge smile on my face as my master gently brushed me. I attached pictures as proof. The side with the larger bristles was much more gentle than I had imagined and removed the tangles from my fur with ease with no pain involved! The softer side feels like I'm being brushed by a gentle cloud of soft and cuddly bunnies. It works wonders on my fur and even though I didn't think it possible, yes, I do in fact look much more handsome. I stared at myself for a good 3 minutes in the mirror when I was done because I just couldn't believe it. My masters were saying something about how soft I am and what a good boy I was and then gave me some treats!

2625,"""Monica \""Monica\""""","""I previously have used a 50/50 vinegar/water mix and VCA[vet hospital]'s Vethical SkinGuard ear cleansing solution with salicylic acid and ALOE on my basset hound. My basset always enjoyed getting his ears massaged and loved the aloe in the Vethical solution more than the 50/50 vinegar mix. I ordered theVirbac Epi-Otic, 8-Ounceas weekly maintenance because I ran out of the Aloe solution. It is blue (they added FD&C;#1 blue) and it does not smell at all like apples as was advertised. It smells like a sterile hospital cleanser.  I'm not complaining about the smell really because it dissipates fast.At first, during the application my basset wasn't into the ear cleansing solution. Usually I do massage more when I flush the ear but this time I hadn't. I am not overly rough when I wipe the inside of his ears but he didn't enjoy it much this first time. I had spilled some on my arm and immediately received a very very slight stinging sensation. So I was wiping while the stinging was happening instead of massaging the ear as much (might it have been stinging more inside his ears? I dunno, he didn't have any open irritation before application).  I did notice for myself that after a minute you don't feel the sensation any longer and your skin feels marginally more hydrated and skin somewhat calmer. After reading the directions it seems that I should squirt it liberally in the canal first, let it sit a few moments and massage ears for long enough for the stinging (if there is any because all pets are different and have different sensitivities), and then wipe once the skin is calmer.  Like I said, the product works but you might want to take note that it could be more comfortable on your pet if you massage a lot more before wiping excess.The directions say: \""Shake well before use. Turn the white nozzle to open the product and then apply liberally into the ear canal. Gently rub the base of the ear and then wipe the interior of the ear flap with cotton or a cloth moistened with Epi-Otic Ear Cleanser.\""The back of the bottle says:\""Virbac Epi-Otic, 8-Ouncewith spherulites is a non-irritant ear cleanser formulated to remove crusts and excessive cerumen.SPHERULITES: An exclusive and patented encapsulation system developed by Virbac; provides slow release of ingredients long after product application.Chitosanide: A natural biopolymer that creates a protective film on the skin and hair.  This reinforces the hydrating and restoring effects of the formulation, helping to protect the skin against damage from the environment.\""PROS:*Epi-Otic does hydrate the skin after applying and I believe I could feel the drying effect and then the Chitosanide biopolymer reacting with my skin hydrating it within moments.*Cuts thru oils well.  Sometimes when I just do a 50/50 vinegar mix with my dog's ear cleanings I can still feel a little oil on my basset's ear. While a little oil is okay in the inner ear, the inside of the outer ear has an oily vinegar effect. With longer ears it's good to use a quality ear cleanser. At least with a basset hound dog this makes a difference.CONS:*The stinging like I mentioned so wait a few moments before wiping excess.*The smell- it's medicinal smelling (not apple!) but it's in your pet's ears and it's doing the job.*Ease of application/chemical harshness.

Yes because it's all around very pleasant- and has a very wonderful smell and simple application because no stinging with the VCA Vethical Skin Guard Aloe ear cleaning solution.EDIT:  Reapplied, waited a long while before massaging and then wiping excess.  My pup still did not enjoy the massaging as much as when we'd used the solution with aloe so at least for my dog, the solution is harsher than I'd like. On the upside I smelled the apple scent while massaging ears but it was so subtle it's not much of a selling point.*Unrelated to review but related to yeast infections in dogs with big floppy ears: Getting an adjustable elevated waterer for your dog has made a huge difference in keeping my basset hound's ears drier (thus making it easier to avoid yeast growth).""",does the job.,3

Over the past 3 months we have been trying to find a food that will (not to sound gross) firm up his poop, as it has been very soft and that can lead to problems. Each new food we tried to give him we gave him 3 weeks on, slowly switching him. We have had him on Kirkland puppy (Chicken), Nature's Domain (Turkey), Taste of the wild (Salmon), and most recently Nature's Variety (Chicken). All of the above foods are rated 4 stars and up by several websites. While all of them are very good dog foods, none of them helped firm him up like the Wilderness Puppy formula has. I am not a vet, but i have done alot of research on the foods, i think it's the combo of 36% protein and 6% fiber (at least 2-3% higher more than most dry dog foods) that has made a world of difference, and im only 1 week into switching him. I wish i could buy the puppy Chicken formula from Amazon (not sold as of this review, currently sold by Petsmart or Petco). I look forward to switching him when he's an adult to the Duck formula.

The other nice feature of these antlers is that they are not halved vertically exposing the spongy bone interior of the antler making them last that much longer. There are areas with the exposed interior but the dog has to work for it which is also great for keeping a moderate-heavy chewer occupied.I personally prefer antlers over rawhide bones for my dog because they are odor-free and they don't stain carpet or leave sticky rawhide pieces behind. Antlers also last much longer than a rawhide. They are a cleaner, more durable alternative to rawhides and dogs love them just the same (however, my dog regularly chooses the antler over a rawhide bone). They might cost more than a rawhide bone but the benefits outweigh the price increase.",Great for Chewers,5

2658,a consumer,"My cat is in the early stages of renal failure and I bought this as part of my efforts to find an appropriate food he would eat.  Unfortunately I've offered this product twice and it was tried for a mouthful and later ignored.  Interestingly, I also have a young cat (formal feral) and even this former dumpster-diver sniffed and walked.  I will continue to offer this and hope it catches on eventually.There are other products for the condition but this one seemed to be the most palatable from reviews.  There also seems to be some controversy over whether a cat in early stages of kidney failure should be fed a low protein or low phosphorus diet.  Further, there seems to be an issue in later stages with cats losing weight and not wanting to eat, and I am not sure if a food like this would encourage eating.  One day at a time.So here I am with the smallest amount one could buy (24 cans).  If this food doesn't get a decent reception soon, I will probably donate it to my vet's office for other sick cats to try.  If you've got an ill kitty, and you've been told to try a low protein/phosphorus food, it can't hurt to do lots of reading and try this, but no miracles in my household just yet!Update March 2010 - It's been 1 and 1/2 years since I wrote the above review.  Your vet advice and results may vary, but my cat has done very well on a normal diet since then.  After doing much reading and talking with our vet, special foods are not yet called for for my cat.  Have your cat's blood levels checked to see if they are doing ok with phosphorous and you and your vet can decide from there if food like this is advisable.  It may be better to discuss if your cat can stay on regular food and use a phosphorous blocker.More and more I am reading that weight loss is a problem for cats in kidney failure so keeping the food desirable to them could be a big deal.  My cat is having more issues with the accompanying hyperthyroidism than with the kidney disease currently, and while he has indeed lost some weight, his blood tests are showing he's doing pretty well.","So far, no go",3

It's safe, convenient, sanitary, and a LOT cheaper than using traditional methods, especially when you consider the value of your time. It doesn't use very much water or electricity and if you buy the cartridges in bulk directly from the company, the cost is very reasonable. I estimate my CatGenie will pay for itself after about 18 months.

The vet even gave me some Albon to try w/ no luck. I finally decided to try Kocci Free and on about the 3rd day I noticed that when he pottied it was not running us out of the house and having to air out the home for an hour or more. He started having normal poops about the 5th day.

By the time we got this me and my boyfriend were eager for him to maybe finally learn. The kitchen.. still a work in prgress but it's been wonderful for the cats. The dog has been very unsure of those creatures and gives them a lot of space if he has to pass by them or wait for me to guide him through the scary maze of cats but if the cats took off running his prey drive kicked in. I don't think he wants to hurt them but he's 60 pounds, they are 10 pounds. And he had problems if the cats wanted to snuggle with us like they always used to before \""that dog\"" came into their lives. The dog just couldn't understand why the cats were allowed to climb all over us and be on the couch and he wasn't (I tried explaining to him it was because he smells and the cats don't). The first day we had the collar on him was the first day my boyfriends cat was able to snuggle with him on the couch like he used to every single day before \""that beast\"" came into HIS house. People may say it's cruel but the cats would claim it's cruel that we can't control the dog when they want to snuggle with us. And it is worth it for our cats comfort (they were here first). Hopefully we won't have to use it much once he learns that cats are boss!Now for the cons, it says it's for a big dog but it seems it's more for a long haired big dog. We have a pit mix with a very short coat and the prongs are huge! And not adjustable. Now being a pit mix, he has lots of skin around his neck but I feel bad when he is trying to sleep and I feel the prongs are in the way. The manual says it's for short periods of training but most of the problems is when he's in the middle of sleeping and will get up to go investigate or chase a cat. The biggest flaw is you have to turn it on through the reciever (collar), not the remote transmitter. So if he seems like he's being good, I will be tempted to turn it off (to save all those batteries you have to buy) but as soon as I think he's just sleeping nice and soundly and won't do anything the cats will come in and test his staying power. Of course if they had the on/off button on the remote, it would save on a lot of batteries and Petsafe couldn't have that now could they!On top of that you really have to push the buttons in hard for it to activate, but one good thing is if the remote gets dropped, or sat on, or stepped on you dog won't get shocked for doing nothing.Next step is trying it for recall training which he is good at until there is another dog!""",There are some cons,4

Pretty pink labeling covers it, and the container is quite solid. There is full disclosure on what is in these treats on the label. It was good to know that there was no by-products, no fillers and they are antibiotic free chicken meat. Now would my dogs like them? I didn't have to call them to come for a treat, as they were all around me, they really have a good sense of smell. I was impressed with the size of the meat. They have to be about 6 inches long and they looked like chicken I had cooked a little too long. They were quite firm. I didn't detect any odor but my dogs sure did, and they wanted what they smelled.So, did they like them?  Oh my yes they did. They each took their treat to their corner and nibbled away with pure joy. They loved them and ran up to me for seconds. I knew these were special.  There was a good amount in the container, I didn't count them but it was filled to the top. I did a little experiment with one of my dogs.

However, when he's overexcited he does ignore it.Also, it stopped working consistently after maybe 20 uses, and it wasn't the battery, because I replaced both batteries, but about half the time I push the button, nothing happens.  Something must be loose inside the remote or the collar.It's also not the best training tool, unless you use it all the time.  My dog understands what the collar does, and is a perfect angel when he has it on.  I, by the way, purchased it because he doesn't always come when called.  We had been practicing recall training for years (practicing just about every day), and he still only came half the time.  I gave up and thought the collar would help.  It does help when he's wearing the collar, since he knows what it does, but when he's not wearing the collar, he still ignores me if there's something more interesting around.Also, this should only be used to correct bad behaviors, not to train new things, because it seems to make my dog sad, and certainly not open to learning.  Dogs need to be happy to be able to learn commands.I don't really use it anymore, and wouldn't recommend it.

2735,Chloe_Webb,"What I really LOVE about this TOY is IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE for my 15lb pup to play with.  Little dogs ARE indeed DOGS, and is exceptionally playful and active and not easy on toys (not a shredder).  I mean, she killed a mole while on an extender leash.  Other than moles, my dog is very social with dogs and people... she loves kids.  She working on her Ph.D. in playing, so the children and her have a blast - the highlight of her day at least.  When she is really kickin' it, her toys are tossed, shook, pounced on, dropped, thrown and when you think you are done they are in your face... it's full on playtime including wrestling for the toy with mom or canine friends. At first, my dog would ONLY play FETCH w/ Look Who is Talking Koala, but that's IT... and she would look at it sideways when it laughed, confused and conflicted, like my doggie instincts are saying that this is wrong, Mom.  She recognized the sound of the laughing children! However, time has passed and now this toy has joined her regular rotation, so I updated my review. She no longer gets disturbed and confused by the giggling, she just jumps, pounces on it, carries it around, fetches it and it is the toy most often at my feet and she a TON. Don't even have to make it giggle! And when it does giggle she goes instantly into play mode.  I think having got the duck and chick version of this toy for xmas helped change her thinking somehow.  THE SIZE IS PERFECT, I think that's part of her love of this toy, she can trigger the noise box of some of them herself, i.e. (the duck) or any of them when she is playing a lot with them.  They are very cute toys, but really, people complaining about the size must not realize I have the same disappointments just with different toys, i.e., Coleman toys, which are gorgeously made, most of which are just way to big for anything bug some fetch.  Also, since she is not a destroyer, generally, her toys require sewing at the seams, they are turning into a favorite.  She does like the koala's fluffy ears a lot, too ;-)  She likes the cat, but it is not as fluffy, the dog noise she just doesn't buy into...

We've bought 5 different harness in varying sizes and the Puppia, Size Small harness is the only one we've found that comes close to fitting her correctly. It is still just a bit on the too-loose side, but anything smaller would be too small. She has a very small, narrow head (like a deerhead chihuahua) and this makes it easy to get this harness off, since there is no adjustment for the neck, but I would warn people to beware if your dog has a large or round head, this may too difficult to remove.My dog was very hesitant about letting me put this harness over her head the first few times, but now she loves it. So much better than being yanked around by the neck with a regular collar and leash. She loves to jump after squirrels and now she won't be choked by a collar any longer.

The filter may actually now be quieter than when it was new, as there appeared to be a slight design change in the new impellers when compared to the old ones. The loudest sound is that of water returning into the tank, which varies from almost inaudible to a gentle splashing sound, depending on whether the water level is above the level of the return chutes or below them. The tank is located in the living room where I watch television, and I'm never distracted by the sounds of the filters.For almost anyone, a single Emperor would provide adequate filtration, however at the time I purchased them, I had seven huge goldfish in the tank, who produced vast quantities of waste matter. Eventually the goldfish grew too large for the tank and were relocated to a pond in the backyard, and the tank was restocked with a variety of colorful tropical fish.The big selling feature for the Emperor 400 is the dual biowheels, which provide a highly oxygenated living space for beneficial bacteria to colonize. These bacteria help remove some of the waste products which the fish produce, resulting in healthier fish, and extending the time interval between water changes, and thus reducing maintainence of the aquarium. Other filters have alternative methods of providing biological filtration, but the biowheel is so effective that it can keep nitrates at an undetectable level. The Emperor filters, both the 400 and the 280, have an adjustable spraybar above the biowheels. Water falling onto the wheels from the spraybar helps insure that the biowheels never stop turning, and allows the user to adjust the speed at which they turn. The standard Penguin filters have biowheels, but no spraybars, and so the biowheels only turn by the action of water flowing beneath them, with no adjustment for speed. I'm still using the original biowheels which came with my filters, with no end in sight. I've never even cleaned them or seen any need to do so.These filters are made of a black, slightly flexible plastic which seems to be less brittle than the transparant material used on some other filters. I used to use the original Marineland brand replacement cartridges, but have since found that some aftermarket filter pads for the Emperor are made with a reuseable frame which snaps together on either side of the filter pad. This allows the user to purchase filter floss in a bulk roll. When the filter pad becomes clogged, I simply cut new floss pads to fit the frame, making the cost of renewing filter pads extremely low.As others have mentioned, each filter has four slots for filter cartridges. And the Emperor 400 comes with two refillable media containers which can occupy two of those slots, if you choose to use them. They can hold extra carbon, zeolite, or other material. I have mine filled with porous ceramic noodles.The Emperor 400 has a control for water volume, so you can turn it down when feeding your fish, preventing all the food from being sucked into the filter. After the fish have finished eating, the volume can be set back to \""high\"", however I have left it in the second slowest postion for weeks at a time, and the fish seemed to be content. I have found that if the volume control is not moved for a long time, it tends to accumulate mineral deposits and become stiff. So, I turn it down every day when feeding, then turn it back up a couple of hours later. Also, if the power is interrupted while water volume is turned down, the filter takes longer to prime itself and begin pumping properly. If power fails when volume is turned up, the filter restarts with no problem when power is restored.The Emperor 400 comes with a cleaning brush for the spray bars and an extension for the water intake to be used if you have a very deep tank. My own tank is fairly deep, and the extension would bring the intake nearer the bottom, however I don't use the extension, and filtration seem fine.When setting up an aquarium, it should be born in mind that the closer to a natural habitat you can get, the healthier your fish will be and the less maintainence will be required. My own tank is set up as follows:Two inches of \""Eco-Complete planted aquarium substrate\"" soil purchased in sealed bags at the local store AquariumConnection. The soil is intended for use in aquariums with live plants, which feed on some of the wastes. In the soil, there are approximately 20 Anubis plants scattered around the tank. The fish love to swim between and around the leaves, or hide behind them. From time to time, eggs are laid on the leaves of the plants. The bright green leaves stand out in vivid contrast against the nearly black soil. Two 15 watt fluorescent lights provide illumination to stimulate photsynthesis in the plants.I strongly recommend that you do NOT use any type of gravel, colored or otherwise, as food falls down into the gravel where fish cannot reach it, and where it rots and fouls the water. If you choose to use gravel, you MUST vacuum the gravel on a weekly basis, and your water still will not be as clean. Gravel equals more work and dirtier water. Sand is better than gravel as food cannot fall down into the sand, but sand still doesn't provide nutrition for live plants. Use Eco-Complete soil or something comparable, both you and your fish will be happier.I also recommend that you do NOT use any type of undergravel filter, as these will also require frequent vacuuming, and eventual dismantling of the tank to clean beneath the filter plate. With the Emperor, you won't need additional filters. And again, undergravel filters equal more work and lower water quality. I NEVER vacuum the soil, and perform a 20% water change every week or so. Filter cartridges tend to last several months.The fish themselves consist of a number of cory catfish, who snuffle around through the soil and pick up whatever falls from above. There are as well golden tetras, cardinal tetras, redline tetras, silver dollars, danios, flying clouds, and mollies, and one otocinclus catfish. Some of the cory catfish are grandfathers several times over, and have grown to a large size in the five years or so they have lived in this tank.I feed them once each day, around 6:00 pm. Supper consists of several spirulina wafers, plus a pinch of flake food about the size of a nickle, which I crush between my fingers to produce many very fine particles.To sum up, the Emperor 400 is an efficient and durable filter which will help provide good water quality and healthy fish.""",Durable and efficient filter for a healthy aquarium,5

The floor surrounding each box is covered in litter daily so we keep hand vacs nearby each box. The cats can walk through a carpeted room and still leave dust footprints on the couch. But all litters track and leave dust from what I've experienced. I also love the light weight of it.

2820,WildScalare,"These have been around a long time.  They are pretty much all I need in a HOB power filter, they move tons of water, the media compartment is roomy, and they come apart easily to clean up if the impeller slows or starts making noise.  The lift tubes can be extended as far as needed with added pieces and the strainer style is good at removing larger debris without clogging too rapidly.  The lift tube is easy enough to pull out and clean off when it is clogged.  Replacement impellers are readily available (and will be eventually needed since these just keep running forever).  The price is appropriate, unlike a lot of power filters now marketed.  A low watt motor attached to a plastic box just shouldn't cost all that much.That said, if you want the &#34;kit&#34; , meaning you intend to use the manufacturer's media cartridges, then pass on the Whisper line.  &#34;Bio-Bag&#34; cartridges are possibly the worst filter media out there.  The floss bag is thin, poor at filtering finer particles, and needs replacing far too often just to maintain mediocre performance.  As a receptacle for carbon (which you may or may not even care to use) it fails since most of the carbon will be at the bottom of the bag and bypassed anyway.  Without carbon, the bag itself is virtually useless as filter media and the  plastic/fiber &#34;bio mesh&#34; is only barely adequate for the size tank this filter is intended.There are clamshell frames available that fit this filter and allow use of your own floss/media.  You can also simply cut some good quality reticulated sponge to size and have a fine filter with permanent mechanical and bio media that simply requires an occasional quick rinse in tank water.I have at least a dozen of these running 24/7, many for several years now, and I've yet to have one quit.  They aren't always the quietest, but not bad.  The impellers do get worn and noisy and have to be periodically replaced to quiet it.  For good flow, the right price, and a long life you can't go wrong.  Just don't expect much if you use Tetra's media in them.",A bare bones workhorse of a filter...,3
2821,John D. Hillmer,"""Cinnamon Spice Flavor 6.6.ounce, large size sticks - here's our review, and the opinions of our dogs!Today our dogs tried out the Zoe Chew Sticks.  These sticks were a hit.  They are similar to Pedigree Dentastix, but I think these last longer.  The 6 sticks are each about 5 inches long and the cinnamon flavor actually smelled pretty good.  The packaging says gluten-free, low calorie, and high protein grain for excellent source of energy.  Our Basset Hound, who usually inhales her treats, actually took some time to get through hers.  Our Rat Terrier chewed hers in great gusto.  She's a bit overweight right now, so it was encouraging to find a \""low calorie\"" treat.  We have a visiting Springer Spaniel and she enjoyed the odd treat to her normal rawhide chips.  I did not give it to my older Beagle as she is on a \""low protein\"" diet and the packaging says \""high protein\"".  As the dogs ate them, there were a few that broke off larger pieces to work on.  I wondered if I could break a stick in 1/2 for the smaller dog, but they do not break, or even bend.  They are not greasy and the packaging has a re-sealable zip top for easy storage.

The bottle was wrapped securely so that it didn't leak while being delivered.I ordered this along with several other products for my furbaby Moulan. She is a 12 yr old cat with lots of allergy issues. Every time I take her to the vet it costs around $150 for them to prescribe medicine for her skin & ears. She will be good for about a month or so, but then the same issues come back. It's so frustrating. She will scratch & lick herself to the point of balding & bleeding.

With a normal brush (think about a non-electric toothbrush) head, the bristles are very close together and absorbent.  With these rubber bristles, they are spaced further apart and non-absorbent so when I brush the toothpaste often ends up in my dogs mouth instead of on the brush.

Yes he is big, yes he is active, but in no way would i describe him as an excessive puller on the leash. i got the harness because he really has a hard time going the same direction i do, meaning he will move to the right while Im trying to go left. so, the harness really did help him gently turn with me. plus its better having any pressure in the front and not on his neck.he is in basic dog obedience and the instructor liked the easy walk harness but had actually recommended another one, should have listened.i liked that the D ring was in the front of the chest and not the back, like a husky pulling a sled.either way, if they decide to make more durable harnesses and i will consider buying another.",RIPS APART TOO EASILY!,3
2865,"""Becky in NOLA \""Becky\""""","The bake a bone is a novelty item. Izzy would probably be just as happy with blobs baked in the oven, but I enjoy using the dog treat maker. The treat maker heated right up, though the light to say it was ready was orange, not green as the book indicated. I made the chicken treat and she loved it. I gave her some soft ones then did the tip on page 20 of the recipe booklet and put the rest in a 350 degree oven, turned it off, and let them dry out for several hours for a more milk bone type crunch.The treats are cute. I did half a recipe as there is no indication in the booklet how many treats each recipe makes and I didn't want to be making treats forever. Just smooth them in the high heat spatula, lock it down, give the oven timer 10 min, there is no timer or off switch on the dog treat maker. If you've used a waffle iron, sandwich maker, or omelet express the technique is very similar.the bake a bone makes four at a time, ten minutes each fill. I like knowing what I'm putting in treats for Izzy, especially since their are so many questionable ingredients these days. While I could probably do the same with mixing a treat together and cooking it in the oven, the bake a bone produces cute little bones and it's fun. Necessary? No. Fun? yes!",Fun novelty item,4

2883,"""M. Kooiman \""nerdette\""""","Well, at least not much sifting and scooping.  My cats have been using the LitterMaid for a couple of weeks now and I have removed the old stinky litterbox from the room.  I had very little difficulty training the cats to use the new box; I just followed the simple instructions that came with the Littermaid.  The only difficulty I had in getting the cats accustomed to the new box was a teenager who thought it hillarious to yell boo at a cat as it watched the box clean itself.  Needless to say, that cat took a little longer getting used to the LitterMaid and the teenager got the privelege of cleaning the old box.Just as it advertises, 10 minutes after use, the &quot;sifter&quot; runs from one end of the box to the other, lifting the clumps and depositting them in the container at the end.  A few times it had a little difficulty with a very large clump and I heard it reverse and try again several times before successfully completing the trip.  I do have a problem with litter being dumped on the floor, either by an energetic cat or the sifter pushing litter in front of a clump and over the edge.Don't start thinking this will reduce how often you have to deal with a litter box.  You still have to empty the container daily, add/rearrange the litter daily and probably vacuum frequently.  It misses the really small clumps so you'll have to sift once in a while.  However, it only takes a minute to do these tasks and it really keeps down the smell.

It's well-built and sturdy except for one piece.My only complaint about this pump is that the circular cover over the impeller can slide free and come off easily.  I use a pre-filter since my goldfish tend to produce a lot of waste, so I had to remove the outer cage covering in order to set up the pre-filter device's hose attachment and tubing.  Also, I use stronger stiffer tubing instead of the usual flexible tubing.  This caused an issue with set-up.  The impeller cover would come loose and I would have to reattach it.  In order to solve the problem, I used two medium-sized metal binder clips to hold the cover onto the pump.  Now, the impeller cover is more secure.  If you are using the outer cage and a different type of filtration system, then this might not be a problem for you.I would have given this pump 5 stars if the impeller cover was more secure by design.

2970,"Charly of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY","I have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Her name is Foxy. This breed sheds A LOT. This rake works well regarding controlling shedding. It is important to follow the directions to avoid irritating dog's skin. Handling the rake is comfortable for the owner. This is important for owners with breeds that have a lot of hair. The hair that is removed during brushing easily comes off the rake. The best feature of this rake is how well it removes excess hair from the undercoat. This is important for breeds who have multi-layered coats. Foxy has a 2 layered coat. Great for her because she is NEVER cold. Bad for me because of the shedding. In order to get the best results, brush your dog at least once daily. This rake is made strong enough to handle daily brushing(s). This rake is not made strong enough to handle being dropped. I dropped mine one time and one of the spikes became loose. I fixed it by resetting spike using pliers but I'm not sure how long it will hold. The biggest competition for this brush, is most likely the FURminator. What drew me away from the FURminator is a lot of reviews stating their dogs hair was cut or ripped off leaving almost bald spots.

And since he's a 9 month old border collie, he's basically an overdriven chipmunk on crack. At home, he is a crate trained angel, knows when to park himself \""in the box\"" and never fusses at being in his well padded cell, taking his nap times with good grace. Which is a blessing, because otherwise, I'd be in need of a well padded cell myself.For travel, I hate breaking down and packing the thing. The puppy spends trips in a seatbelt buckled into the back of the SUV, and when we get where we're going, it can be a challenge. So, I've been looking at portable crates; let's not call them travel crates, since to me that means more \""suitable for shipping your dog in the cargo hold of a plane or freighter.There are some hits and misses with the ABO Gear crate. I wanted a crate that was easy to transport, reasonably sturdy, stayed closed, but is easy to open, had good visibility (from outside and from within), and was easy to clean in case of accidents. The large size is for dogs over 35 pounds, and the Barkspawn, at just under 40 pounds, had gobs of space. As a medium size dog, he could lay out full length, so I suppose a medium size crate would have done better. He did not fuss at being in a mainly fabric crate and sat down quietly to watch me work in the kitchen.On the plus side, the crate is light enough to travel with, roughly 10 pounds. It comes folded in its own custom duffel, made of the same material as the crate itself, a lightweight but fairly tough polyester over an aluminum frame. The crate doesn't fold flat, but sort of accordion collapses into a smaller shape with the same length. It took less than a minute to lock the crate into it's usable state. The crate has two opening panels that take up most of the top and virtually all of one side. Both are single zipper closures and the flaps can be rolled back and secured with a hanging Velcro fastener. The main side opening provides great visibility, the top a little less. The bottom and ends are solid fabric, and the opposite side has a view panel a few inches wide at dog-eye height. All visibility panels are black nylon mesh.On the minus side, the crate is a little too lightweight. I leaned my weight slightly on what should have been the strongest parts of the frame, and it immediately tried to twist and give way. Not sturdy at all! The Barkspawn was in it at the time and didn't look too concerned, but he's been a lab-rat for my dog product reviews in the past, so he's grown to expect mom to do weird things. But, anything heavy falling against the crate would easily collapse it, dog and all.Had The Barkspawn objected to the crate, there would have been very little in the construction to stop him rolling it, or possibly trying to claw or gnaw out the mesh.  Sometimes while traveling, he does not want to have a time out, and this was a real concern.  A larger dog could probably roll this laying against the side  and make short work of it easily if he meant to get out.Bottom line - If your dog has a placid nature, this would work. If your dog has separation anxiety issues, or would physically object to the containment, this is not a good crate substitute. If you are trying out the idea of crate training, this is not the crate to do it in - instead get a steel wire crate of more solid construction. If your dog is smaller, and kennel/housetrained, this actually would be a nice little pen to keep her confined while on travel, while still giving her room to play and move around a bit.For my purposes, it supports the 'easily portable' need, but it is not 'reasonably sturdy'.""",Not very sturdy = Limited usefulness,3

In addition to water therapy ( our own in a kiddie pool), I started him on Glycoflex tablets. Even with the hip dysplasia, he was always very active and did extremely well until 2 years ago. At that time, he had back surgery to repair a ruptured disk and was diagnosed with degenerative disk disease. After the surgery, we switched from regular Glycoflex tablets to the Glycoflex III soft chews. His running and jumping days are over( doctor's orders)and he has other age related issues, but he gets around fine and still wants to play.I highly recommend any of the Glycoflex products, especially these soft chews for older dogs or dogs recovering from surgery or injuries.

Tequila is very picky about his dog food and does not eat hard brown dog food for some reason. With this dog food being multi-colored and having beef pieces I was hoping he would eat all of it.Tequila perked up the second I opened the bag. You could tell that he loved the smell. I gave him one of the beef chunks and he immediately devoured it. I filled his bowl with the food and he excitedly ran over to it and started eating. When I walked into the kitchen later, there were hard brown chunks of food placed everywhere throughout the room. Dang dog! He did eat everything else in the bowl. So, he likes it better than a lot of other dog foods. As far as I know, there is not a dog food on the market that he will eat all of....so it gets four paws up from him. I would buy this food for my pup again.""","My Dog Loves The Beef, The Brown Hard Pieces Not So Much",5

I have two spayed female cats:  2 1/2 yr old sisters raised from 2 weeks old (abandoned under my porch by a feral cat).  One started spraying the drapes.  She's a sweet quiet cat, not dominant, and the sisters get along fine.  They have free access to the outside all day; are kept in at night.  I put two diffusers in my 1340 sf house.  I didn't see any change in behavior and if anything, the spraying increased.  It really increased when I started getting after my cat for doing it (speaking sharply to her when I caught her at it - I'd never hit her).  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I KNOW you're not supposed to do that.  I do love my kitties but I've always been a dog person - now I get it.  I do think I discovered the problem though.  I had rearranged the guest room where the second food bowl was.  This was the bowl where the spraying cat often ate.  She ate from the other bowl in another room too so I didn't think it was a biggie.  But obviously I don't know cats (I'm learning!).  I returned the food bowl to its spot and added a second, larger litter box too.  No spraying since then and my cat seems very very content.

He finally gave in and at some, but it's apparent that he doesn't like it.  We're working up to the recommended dosage and hoping that it works for his rotten kitty breath.

3184,S.L,"Entry April 2014:The **food portions are erratic**. Sometimes they don't come down.  I would be very worried if I had to depend on this to feed my cat.  I would say portions come down something like 75% of the time. I am lowering the number of stars to a 2 as I had to stop using it.Entry one March, 2014:I purchased this pet feeder and have problems getting my 4 months old cat (Miso) to accept it. At first I thought it was due to him getting bored of the food. So I went through various different types of foods. Eventually I decided to use a small dish instead of this feeder and Miso was quite pleased to eat the food he would not eat from the Pet Feeder bowl.  I then moved the dish to the base of the pet feeder and Miso was more than willing to eat from the small dish.A mature cat needs about 250 calories a day. The dry cat food I use is the Evo brand, ( a premium grain free  dry formula). One cup of this food contain 530 calories. So ideally Miso should receive only half a cup of this food daily. The problem is that  half a cup in the Pet Feeder's fountain looks scattered, and not very appealing to a single cat.  For comparison purpose, imagine being fed half a cup of rice in a large plate, versus a small plate.  You would find the presentation rather unappealing, and besides, it would force you to adopting a chicken like technique to bring the food to your mouth. This is precisely what Miso finds so difficult and thus the reason why he doesn't like eating from the Pet Feeder's  bowl.LeBistro should design a Pet Feeder especially  for single cats, and one whose bowl is not so large and unsightly. Another possibility is to design a feeding bowl for cats that attaches to the existing pet feeder.  If you have more than one cat then this Pet Feeder with its current bowl is fine.One option that people who purchase this feeder have is to have a smaller bowl  3D printed  for this pet feeder, but  I am not sure if non-toxic 3D printing resins  exist; if such resins exist, someone wishing to make some money could print a smaller more attractive bowl for single cats and sell them in Amazon.  I would be the first to buy one.There are other issues with this PetFeeder. One is that the plastic seems of poor quality, and the electrical infrastructure a bit flimsy and cheap. Of course, this does not prevent the unit from working. I also have no idea what kind of plastic was used to manufacture the feeder and it is a concern as it could be toxic to cats.I will keep you posted on the pet feeder as I just got it and have been using it for only a few days. I am rating this pet feeder with a 4 because as I said it is fine for a house with many cats, or a dog. But it you have a single cat, my rating is more like a 3 stars.","Huge and unsightly for a  single cat, but ok for a  dog, or a household with many cats",2

I had a feeling she wouldn't care for this. She loves Fancy Feast, and only then the grilled variety kind. She doesn't care for the standard mushy-looking food at all. Same case here. Now, perhaps this food is healthier than some(I guess), but none of that matters if your cat refuses to eat it. Cats are picky and eat only what they like.

However, after a tragedy in my family, I was searching for a more affordable (yet, quality) kibble for my canine friend. I decided on the Large Breed 60+ Chicken Formula.I've been so busy with stressful activities that I hadn't paid as much attention as I should have been, to the gradual changes my dog was experiencing.  It's like I had a sudden wake-up moment.  He has been itching and scratching more than ever and his coat is very dull.  He also has been shedding worse than ever.  Dog fur is flying everywhere and is now a condiment in my house.  I can rake and rake, to no avail.  And, it's not just blowing coat.  I've been through that, this presents differently.I had some misgivings about going to any Diamond product because there have been too many recalls to add any degree of confidence, but the 'Large Breed 60+' formula was recommended by a fellow Shiloh owner as being a good product for the cost, and he has had success with it.I'm expecting a delivery of Pinnacle, at any moment and will gradually reinstate it as my Shiloh's primary kibble.  It is significantly more expensive, but I'm willing to go for Top Ramen a couple of nights a week, if I have to, to have my dog  return to his state of former comfort and beauty.Now I must add, that this is the first kibble he has had that has been a 'chicken' formula. He has always done lamb, or the fish kibbles.  Perhaps he just doesn't do well with 'chicken.'  I've learned that some dog owners swear their dogs don't do well with the poultry products.  Prior to my Shiloh, I was owned by an Akita for 12 years.  He couldn't tolerate chicken kibble, either.  So, maybe that's the case.All said, if you're having a good response, I'm happy for you because the kibble is cost effective and many tout its quality.  It just hasn't worked for us, therefore, I didn't want to give less than three stars, since it may just be my dog's reaction.

3244,John Catenacci,"""I have been using this on my six month old golden retriever for about two weeks, spraying him every other day or so and rubbing it in. He loves it, immediately relaxes (this dog hardly EVER relaxes!).He is suffering from flea allergy I think - my vet tells me a dog can be itchy long after the fleas are gone (he definitely had fleas and flea bites but that was months ago). He has no fleas now but is still feeling itchy all over his body, legs, tail, whole body really - and, while he has no hot spots, I don't want to see them start either. And it is not fun watching your dog suffer. When I spray him, he immediately stops scratching and obviously looks relieved. So, no doubt in my mind that it works.After reading up on the toxicity concern, all the sources I checked said it is toxic to cats - and small dogs are more of a concern and overuse is not good and the dog injesting it by licking can be a concern too.I do think the company needs to do better labeling - what is the concentration of the tea tree oil and what do they have to say about it's use and toxicity? If the concentration is very low, I will feel better. So, I am going to call them and ask.My own experience, though, on this 60 pound dog, is it does work and I have not seen any negative symptoms - but I will not depend on it as an every day treatment either. And, if he starts licking it, I will not use it anymore. Ingestion seems to be a more toxic pathway than simply administered on the skin.This is a follow up. I called the company in TX and asked the woman who answered if the company realized that tea tree oil is toxic to dogs and cats at some concentrations. She replied that they knew that. I told her that their product is getting hammered on Amazon and it might be helpful to know the concentration - maybe it is so low as to not be much of an issue. She became quite curt when I asked what the concentration of TTO was that they used in their product, telling me that information was propietary so she could not tell me! I guess their philosophy is \""just trust me\"".Don't think I will buy this product anymore. I have dropped my rating from 4 to 2 stars.Hope this helps""",Works;toxicity a concern,2

I couldn't believe that a 7 pound dog wrapped in a towel could better me but she did (she is the most stubborn dog I've ever encountered but she is a lover, too).I am grateful to Pill Pockets.  My dogs have realized that the pill is snuck inside but they love the taste they \""compromise\"" and take it in return for the chicken taste.  In fact, if one dog takes a pill, the other has to get a pill pocket, too.They aren't to appealing to me and yes, I wash the greasy feel off my hands afterwards, but they weren't made to accommodate my taste anyway.Well worth the price, although I wouldn't complain if they lowered it.

Given that she's loved all the other Chuck-it products AND that she's constantly dropping the rubber tennis balls in my lap to play fetch, I thought this might be a nice alternative for in the house throwing.So far so good. She'll still try to get me to throw the rubber tennis balls (they are her absolute favorite toy) but if I don't bite, she's already taken to grabbing her newest Chuck-it, the Indoor Roller and I'm happy about that. I can toss it right against the wall and it doesn't make a loud sound (nice in an apartment) and she seems to like it just as much as all her other Chuck-it stuff (save the rubber balls = puppy Crack). In the store I tested out the Indoor ball and this one and the ball seemed to be awkward, even for her, a rott/shep large dog, to grab onto so I went with this one because of the hole in the center and I feel I've made the best choice. She's playing with it, she likes it, it's easy for her to pick up, and it's been much better/safer for indoor play than even the regular tennis balls - which also make a loud thud if they hit the wall.I'd recommend this as well as many other Chuck-it toys. I've become a believer in the brand for sure for long lasting toys that the dog actually enjoys and chooses from her toy box (oh how many toys I've bought and tossed out over time!) to play with.PS - I did not buy the tossing arm that goes with this because I didn't see any need for distance-throwing inside the house.",New toy for Christmas - already enjoying it!,5

We adopted an 8mo old Cattle Dog mix from the shelter and lost quite a few leashes ($$!) due to us carelessly leaving where he could have access to them.  Two seconds and we'd turn around and the leash was in pieces.  I honestly don't even know how many we lost.Anyway, we were at a boutique pet store and learned about the Lupine guarantee.  The patterns are super-cute.  The boutique store even threw in a matching key chain when I bought Odie a new collar and leash!Lupine has lived up to their guarantee with us.  We've lost one leash and one collar since our first purchase.  The leash was a victim of careless setting on chair followed by a voracious cattle dog getting a hold of it.

They were not too interested with the programmed movements which are very limited even with the manual mirror adjustment on the top.

Also when I leave it alone they only seemed to be interested in the sound and walked right up to it to investigate. So, I never turned it on when I couldn't manually play with them because I didn't want them to walk right up and look into the laser. There is a button on the back, you push it once for programmed movement, push and hold it a few seconds to keep the beam steady for manual play, or push one more time to turn off. If you leave it on it turns itself off in 15 minutes.*Update: the laser no longer works right. It hardly moves now and the laser is no longer pinpointed or focused, it's all spread out and large, so it doesn't attract their attention even if I do it manually! There is no way to focus it. Don't know what happened because I hardly used it. All in all I'd look for something else that's cheaper because this doesn't last and the cats prefer a manual laser anyway.

3399,Cindy,"I bought two of these a few months ago -- one for me and one for a friend.  My 15 month old male cat loves his ball.  He didn't have a problem with eating so fast and then getting sick but he would definitely eat and overeat.  Plus, I had a habit of filling the bowl up too much.  This ball serves exactly one cup which is their daily allowance. I think he has lost a half pound in the few months he's been on it and I think this will help him live along and healthy life.  Usually I fill it half way twice daily.  I've even filled it all the way and he paces what he eats (there will be some left over the next day).  A few downsides:  If your cat is ball crazy, mine is, -- he may play with this even when he's not hungry and leave bits a food on your floor.  Also, it's a bit noisy and if you live in a small apartment you can hear it (in the middle of the night, etc).  Speaking of size, I love that it's small and doesn't take up room on my counter.

3405,Silvester Percival,"As I have said in reviews of other Nutrience dog foods, this is really good stuff, warranting 4.5- and 5-star ratings on most dog food rating websites.  This means, in other words, that it contains a lot of good ingredients and very few bad ones.  These quality ingredients are not just a finicky preference for dog owners who want to squeeze a few more years of life out of their pets; it improves life DAILY for dogs with allergies.I have an English Springer Spaniel with terrible food and skin allergies.  If I feed him ANY dog food that contains grain fillers, he breaks out, develops rashes on his tummy, itches like crazy, gets puffy eyes, and in general is totally miserable.  Finding the right food has been an ongoing quest.  Nutrience passes with flying colors: my Spaniel has never been healthier.  Better yet, he loves the taste, and gobbles it up almost as fast as I can scoop it into his bowl.With these generalities aside (which apply to all three kinds of Nutrience food I've tried), let me say a few specific things about the chicken flavor sold here:*  The smell is really nice for a dog food.  Have you ever bought one of those cheap dog foods from a department store and it smelled like stale garbage?  Well, not the case here.  There is a very rich, fresh, almost pleasant meat smell.  I think some of the freshness is the result of the large kernels (see below).  Kind of like how coffee beans hold freshness better than coffee grounds, my theory is that the large kernels help to hold in freshness longer.*  Note well that the kernels are large -- like marble size or bigger.  I probably would not feed this food to any dog smaller than, say, 20 pounds owing to choking hazards or difficulty chewing, but it's fine -- even good! -- for bigger dogs like my Spaniel, who weighs about 50.  Just keep that in mind and there will be no problems.*  Be sure to read the label at the bottom of the bag where it specifies how much Omegas, glucosamine, and chondroitin this food contains.  You will notice that the Turkey, Chicken, and Herring contains higher levels of these ingredients than some of the other, cheaper options from Nutrience, so purchase accordingly.  The fantastic Seven Fish Medley formula (which I've also tried and love) is similar to this option.Overall, I highly recommend this food!",Great food for dogs with allergies!,5

It's nice to have a game where you sit down with your cat and are really playing it together. On the other hand, you have to do the work, it's not a toy you can just leave out for your cat to entertain himself, at least not for mine.I like the way the box is constructed. It seems well made and has an elegant aesthetic compared to most pet toys.The mouse, as you can see in the product picture, should be perpendicular to the stick but after just two play sessions mine has become tilted so that it is almost in a straight line with the stick and this makes it difficult to poke it up through the holes in the box.Another issue is that now that we have played a few times, Ronnie immediately gets more interested in the side of the box where I'm sticking my hand and the stick - like he's figured out the secret to the game and it usually puts an end to the session.I'm giving it 4 stars ('I like it') because of its uniqueness, good looks and interest my cat shows and taking into consideration how many other more disappointing cat toys are out there.","Cute, Smart Game - Mouse not attached to stick well.",4

I did not want to put him on barbiturates since he is already on other medications for his arthritis, so after a good bit of research (and a quick call to the vet for an official \""OK\"") I started him on the Cholodin tabs.What a difference.

I will not say he is completely symptom free, but he is no longer bumping into walls in broad daylight (his eyesight was fine at the last vet visit three months ago), getting stuck under the table, falling down stairs, staring into space during feeding time, and (most heartbreaking) not responding to the invitation to play with his favorite stuffed squirrel.

3447,Observe_the_cat!,"""Updated!!Well, I ended up tossing this box and going back to my standby, the Clevercat top-entry box.  Why?  Because my kitty turned out to be a \""kicker\"" and got litter every.where.  Also, for some reason, he would manage to pee exactly where the top and bottom meet, so I'd end up with a pee-soaked lid and pockets of pee in the liner.Bottom line: If your cat isn't a litter kicker, is small, and you have a tiny space, this will suffice.---Like others have said, this box is best for a single, small cat.  While kitty isn't exactly the tiniest cat, he makes it work.  He took to this very quickly.  This box replaced his CleverCat top-entry box (still my favorite) because kitty isn't too great at getting in/out of that without getting his ablutions on himself.

We knew he was too small to be a 50% mix of mastiff, but he was also under weight. We got him and decided we should see what kind of dog he is using this highly recommended DNA test. I was skeptical, but bought it anyway. We did the test and about 2 weeks after they received it we got our results back.The PDF you get is very nicely written, and it looks very professional. The results however were not very good. Our dog when we got him weighed about 17 pounds. He had hookworms and was loosing weight. While the test results were in our dog got back to a normal and now he weighs 28 pounds. According to the results he is a dachshund beagle mix with maybe a little of 2 different types of shepard?!When comparing our dog to the breeds he is not anywhere near either of those.

They both are like a Diaper Genie, with a refillable bag system.  Drop the waste into the top, pull the handle, and the odorous material falls into the waiting bag below.  When full, the case opens in the middle for getting the bag of goodies out, and there is a cutter inside to seperate the section from the rest of the unit.It all works pretty well.  The Litter Genie is a little less expensive, but its build quality is a little lesser, feeling cheaper made from every perspective.  The button that keeps the top and bottom together is not great, letting the two halves seperate very easily should one pick up the unit.  Bend and try as we might, we couldn't get the latch to stay securely closed.  The spring action on the Litter Genie's waste gate doesn't feel as well done as it is on the Litter Locker, though it works pretty okay.

Obviously, this manufacturer did not even test this seat, or they did and didn't bother to fix the problem!I bought mine 2 years ago and returned it. No matter how hard I tried, moving the pet seat around in my car, when my dog got in the pet seat, he would get scared because the seat would collapse at the legs. The legs fold in but when you fold them out to keep the seat up tall so the dog can see out the window, they don't stay open! It's very poor manufacturing/quality control.If you don't care to have the legs open and intend to keep them folded and closed when using the seat, then it won't be a problem, but the safety belt still is. It is very loose and cannot be properly adjusted. If you should happen to be in an accident, your pet would go flying, even if you have him hooked by his harness because where you hook it on the dog, it just doesn't stay securely on. Avoid this product and if you have already bought it and don't like it, make sure you return it.

3500,Melisa,Build up good bacteria in my tank.  It was recommended by my fish store.  I always put some in when doing water changes.,Good product,5
3501,Jeremy Storly,"The science:Nitrifying bacteria exists on surfaces in the aquarium, such as the glass, gravel, plants, decorations, and most importantly in the filter media.  The more surface area, the greater the potential for nitrifying bacteria to grow.  This is why a bio-sponge or sponge filter is a great asset to your aquarium: a sponge provides plenty of surface area for the nitrifying bacteria to grow.  Nitrifying bacteria clings to these surfaces like glue, and does not exist in the water column.  Its presence can be detected by testing the levels of ammonia, nitrites and nitrates present in the water column.  Ideally, your water should have 0ppm Ammonia, 0ppm Nitrites, and less than 5ppm Nitrates.The consequences:It follows that no 'cycle' type product can effectively help cycle your tank.  Only transferring surface area, like a piece of a used bio-sponge, from an already-cycled tank can reduce the time it takes to cycle a new tank.  For this reason, either Dr. Tim's Aquatics Waste-Away Natural Aquarium Cleaner is either a total scam, or it contains some different form of bacteria that does not exist on surfaces, but in the water column itself.  This bacteria would also have to have a high tolerance for changes in temperature and erratic storage conditions.  Since this is not a product being sold to help cycle your tank (a definite scam), it is possible that it does contain some other form of bacteria that lives within the water column and helps consume waste.The anecdotal evidence:I used this product in two of my tanks, a slightly overstocked 55-gallon tank with four goldfish and two bristlenose plecos, and a 75-gallon tank with five goldfish.  I perform partial water changes on these two tanks every three days, so I decided to use the product immediately following a water change so I could observe the results.It did seem that the 'Waste-Away' product did reduce the amount of waste present in the 55-gallon tank.  Since this tank is overstocked, I vacuum the gravel every time I do a partial water change and collect the dirty water in a white bucket.  It is quite easy to see the waste, and normally I remove quite a lot of waste from the gravel.  After using 'Waste-Away', the amount of waste I collected in my bucket appeared to be reduced, although there is no way to scientifically measure this.My 55-gallon tank is filtered by one Whisper 60 HOB and one Penguin 350 HOB filter.  When the bio-wheels slow or stop in the Penguin 350, I rinse or replace the filter cartridges.  After using 'Waste-Away', this was not necessary, but again, it may not have been necessary in the first place.I also run two Hydro Pro IV Sponge Filters in my 55-gallon, so the ammonia spike the 'Waste Away' label warns of due to breakdown of waste would not occur in my tank due to the massive biological filtration capacity of these sponge filters.My 75-gallon tank is filtered by both a Fluval 306 canister and Penguin 350 HOB filter.  I perform my water changes for this tank in the same way I do for my 55 gallon, but because of the nature of the filtration and the pebble-sized substrate I use in this tank, I seldom remove a noticeable amount of waste.  Sometimes, as in the other tank, I have to rinse or replace the cartridges for the Penguin 350.  I did not have to do so after using 'Waste-Away', but again, this is purely anecdotal.Conclusion:I have my doubts whether this product performs as advertised.  I have these doubts in part because of the ineffectiveness of the majority of bacterial additives which are advertised to help cycle a tank.  Although this product is not intended for the purpose of cycling (a definite scam), I doubt whether a bacteria kept in a liquid in a bottle exposed to variations in temperature could successfully break down waste in an aquarium.  It seemed to me that I did notice slightly less waste in my 55-gallon tank when I performed a partial water change three days after using this product, but if so the effect was negligible.  On the other hand, I did not see any negative effects in my tank.Try this product if you like, but I would recommend spending money on more reliable, effective, and cost-efficient means of increasing biological filtration in your tank, such as a high-quality sponge filter.",Placebo Effect?,3

3503,stacie,"My cat enjoyed this grass very much. She's an indoor/patio only cat, and she seemed to really like the new stimulation. I also potted some to take over for my parent's cats. One of my folk's cats was constantly trying to get into my mother's house plants, and this ended up being a much better alternative for both the cat and my mom. One of my parent's cats stays indoors all the time, while the other makes frequent trips outdoors, and they both seemed to equally enjoy the sweet grass treat.After seeding the pots, and setting them on a window sill (winter in Michigan)there were two days of nothing (as expected). On the third day I gave the pot a little light watering and when I came home that night there were sprouts a 1/2 inch high. After that they took off and grew to a height of about 5-7 inches in two days. I was a bit surprised at just how fast they ended up growing! I would recommend only seeding a little amount of it though. I seeded about a tablespoon and a half in 4 inch diameter pots, and it ended up being too much even for my folk's two cats to get through in almost two weeks (which is when the grass started to get weepy and die off). All of the cats nibbled on the grass every day, but it's not like grass is a major part of their diet, and it was just too much. I think I'll cut the amount of seeds roughly in half next time. I should also mention that the grass was really low maintaince, needing barely any watering after the initial growth (and even then I only gave a couple very light waterings). I'd buy it again, although I'm sure I won't have to for a very long time given how well it grows, how little is needed, and the amount that comes in the bag!",Sweet Treat For Indoor Kitties,4

3581,J. Boyer,"It's a great concept to in sucking water out of your tank. I have used it for several tank changes and cleanings now and have a few gripes.1. If you use CaribSea Eco Complete substrate, the micro rocks and bits will clog the outake valve.2. The reverse flow where you can add water -- haven't figured out why you would do this as a majority of the tanks are temperature regulated. Your hose water is way colder than your tank, other than to flush the hose out, it's pretty much useless unless you hook it up to your sink and then regulate the temperature that way.3. What a waste of water! It uses expelling water from your hose/sink to suck/propell the water out of your fish tank. To change a 75G tank 20% water, it takes a while to drain out the water. Unless you're collecting the water for watering shrubs/plants, it's going down the drain or pooling up outside in your grass. If you're water conscience, I wouldn't recommend this style of cleaning.With every gripe, there are some sun spots!1. It has impeccable  suction. It can suck up a whole tube of gravel, I usually have to either regulate it with the shut off valve or pinch the cord to release the gravel.2. The bushings and connections are solid brass, not chincy.3. Comes with adapter pieces for different sink/hose types which is very useful.4. Quality of tubing is very nice, soft and hasn't kinked or flattened during storage.I would recommend buying it but just be aware of my gripes above.

3582,S. Lipson,"I love this product and find that it works fabulously on my 20 gal tank with typical medium sized gravel. I did however run into manufacturer defects (all exactly the same issue) on 3 units before finally going to a different pet store and purchasing a fourth. All units had a crack in the plastic body seam on the upper most part. The crack did not effect function, but I felt like it was going to crack further or that water might get in the battery compartment, because the crack made a gap in the top cover over the batteries. So it started off a hassle, but I find this works so efficiently and is so easy to clean that I am very glad I stuck with it. I love Amazon, but in lieu of possible manufacturing defects, I would strongly advise buying this in a bricks and mortar store so that you can easily exchange it or get your money back. I did find that when I tried to use the vacuum with only one extension piece beneath the impeller rather than both extension pieces it did jam fairly easily with tiny gravel bits. When I use both extensions I have never had a jam of the impeller. All the debris is captured in the mesh compartment and it is very satisfying to watch it accumulate. One word of advice is to be very careful to not over clean your tank as I did several times in the beginning and probably killed many fish. I was enjoying using this thing so much and found it so easy to use that I both cleaned too diligently and too often before realizing what harm I was doing to the fish's aquatic habitat balance. :( My local pet store manager told me she hated the powered vacuums because you can too easily over clean your tank (too bad I got this info 3 months into my hobby!) and then if you follow up with a water change after cleaning, you'll further dilute the too small amount of bacteria (fish's natural healthy habitat) left in your tank. I was doing that too, and changing or rinsing my filter out as well-all huge mistakes. Painful learning curve for me and even worse for the poor fish. Now I know to not clean as thorough, as often, or to change out more than 20% of the tank water, and to not change the filter at the same time as I clean the tank. Hopefully I will spare some other novice terrible mistakes with this review. For the well seasoned fish hobbyist with an established tank, I think this vacuum will be greatly appreciated for it's efficiency, ease of use, and easy clean up. For those of you who are new to this, do your research before setting up your tank or getting any fish. Read everything you can find and ask a well versed fish hobbyist or reputable pet store employee to teach you everything you need to know up front. Listen well and take notes!","Love this product, but advise to buy in a store...",5

We are particularly anxious because they have never moved before. We have had this diffuser plugged in for two weeks now and it does seem to be calming the cats. Their bad behavior is sporadic and includes occasionally spraying and clawing objects. In the past two weeks I have not noticed them doing any of these behaviors.

After a few weeks I also noted that my dog's coat is soft and shines.Another positive to Taste of the Wild is that their formulas are similar enough between Hi Prairie, Pacific Stream and Wetlands Canine that I can rotate the menu a bit and keep my pup happily chomping down on his food. Previously my dog would tire of the same dog food after only a few weeks.For anyone with a dog with food allergies I highly recommend Taste of the Wild.

Her nose streamed constantly, she vomited daily, did nothing but sleep, ate practically nothing.  For six months she was to the veterinarian monthly for hydration and steroid injections.  In August, when she was barely clinging to six pounds, I switched her over to Wellness kitten food, both canned and dry in an effort to maximize her calorie intake.  I researched all the cat foods, and Wellness was no grain, high in anti-oxidants, no by-products, and 18% fat content (canned is 17% fat), vs about 7% fat in premium adult cat foods).Amazingly, over a couple of months, she stabilized.  Her appetite increased and her vomiting decreased to a currently once or twice a week--which, as a cat lover, you already know--is par for the course.  She became more alert and wakeful, more her loving old self.  Today I took her to the veterinarian for the first time in six months--her semiannual blood work was due--and she'd gained 1/2 pound!!!

What I like most about keeping the dogs tethered, they are not able to unexpectedly jump out of the car when the door is open. While tethered, just clip on a leash, then un-clip the car tether, when your ready. You will have more control so they don't hurt themselves with an unexpected wiggly leap!

3714,Jennifer O Cote,"I've used Feliway a few times over the years, and I've had differing results, depending on the cat. The first time I bought it was for my very fearful, feral cat. I used it for several months, and I saw no difference in her.After that experience, when my vet recommended I try it for my Bengal, who suddenly started urinating anywhere he could find paper, I was skeptical. But I also was tired of cleaning up urine, and nothing else we tried (replacing litter boxes, adding new litter boxes, changing to a different type of litter) worked.I ordered a refill to see what would happen.Within just hours of it it being plugged in, we saw a difference in our Bengal. Not only did he stop urinating, he stopped howling (he's neutered, but wants to go outside, and he'll howl for hours on end because he's not allowed), and he became overly affectionate. A cat who never wanted his stomach touched rolled over and took belly rubbing for fifteen minutes.When the refill ran out, he immediately started urinating around the house again, even with the use of Urine Destroyer and No Marks!. But I ordered another refill, and he stopped shortly after it was plugged in.I don't think it's the answer to every cat's problems, but I know we saw a marked improvement in him. And we've tried the dog counterpart (DAP) on our puppy with separation anxiety, and it worked wonders for him. I highly recommend you try it.

On day 3 I had to re-tie the string back to the metal spinner. On day 4 the long feathers are pretty hopelessly mangled. And every day the connector between the two poles sucks. I have a 7 pound manx that manages to pull it apart and take the top half off. Not to mention my 16 pound bengal that really only needs to swat it to get the two halves apart. I suppose I could tape them together but storage would be an issue. And leaving it out would result in cat induced mayhem. 6 days of use for 15-20 minutes and the toy already looks rough.

The less clever cats are fed in the new version. The old model admittedly comes with too many low 'starter' tubes, but the new model doesn't exactly offer a challenge, and zero extra tubes are available to fit it.  One cat simply reaches a paw down to the bottom of the new model tubes, of any height, and yanks it right out of the base. It's an open bottomed tube, so he can catch hold of it, no problem.The old version has it's tubes somewhat 'locking' into the base (as you can see at the bottom of the pictured tubes for the level three add ons) and you need to use a twisting motion, holding the outside of the tube, to remove them. No interior claw holds, on the old model tubes, either, completely smooth inside. At some point I expect the base of either model to get flipped over, but so far it's not happened.This model has molded ridging around the tubes, acting as mini mazes for small food pieces as well.  Both Earthborn and Orijen dry food falls into those ridges, nicely.

I received the blue design with the writings and it is simply adorable. That kind of coloring livens up any room, but particularly the darker hues.Overall, I think my adult dog benefits from the bed the most because it is higher than the other dog beds in the house. It doesn't have that hollow space that dog beds have in the middle - this is thanks to the wonderful design, not just because the bed is new (I've had concave doggy beds that were out of the box and had indentations in them).I like that the cover is completely machine washable as I tend to wash doggy beds at least once a month, but often every two weeks.This bed might be a bit on the price side, but compare it to the price of the human bed, and the cost of sharing that \""big\"" bed with your pet (I'm always afraid for my dachshund to jump up and down from so high up), this bed is definitely worth it.""","good for the environment, good for your dog",5

3760,Michael Maryland,"I have decided to completely re-write my initial review for this product.  I bought this fountain as a Gold Box Deal for $40.  After months of use here's what I have to say;It took my cat some time to warm up to this fountain, but after a week or two she was not longer scared of it.  For this time, though my cat was making her way to the toilet to drink, something I have rarely caught her doing otherwise.  (I put her old water dish near the fountain to prevent this)  This fountain is NOT a set it and forget it type of deal.  It NEEDS CLEANED A LOT.  After just a week of use with a single cat, the sides of this fountain touching water will become slimy, not to mention the little bits of food that find their way into the water.  This is also about the amount of time it takes my cat to go through the reservoir meaning I have to refill and clean it once a week If i want to keep it nice and clean.  This also means you will need to buy LOTS OF FILTERS, although I have started to use each filter through two cleanings, rinsing it off well in between.  If not cleaned in under a week, I feel that the water in this fountain is likely MUCH DIRTIER than water you would refill in a simple bowl daily.  Because of this, I cannot definitively say that this product provides healthier water for your pet than a simple bowl, unless you clean it practically twice a week.  Even then, Id still be skeptical as I will normally change my pets water dish when I wake up and before I go to bed.  I saw someone say that they put the pieces in the dishwasher and I have tried this twice, but it does not remove the slime coating from the plastic.  For me, this product is more trouble than its worth and I would not recommend it.

3769,Eva,"""I tried this food after switching my dog from another food that left him with a dry, flaky coat and apparently wasn't very satisfying because he was always hanging around the kitchen begging for more food. I did a slow transition into Beneful, mixing some of his old food, with the new food over the course of a week. Clearly he likes the taste because he gobbles it down and leaves nothing behind. I have noticed his coat is already looking better and he seems less hungry after meals, which is great because he's not begging all the time. The zipper top bag is very convenient because I don't have to worry about the food drying out before it's gone. Price-wise, it's a good value for this size bag. On the negative side, I was very disappointed to see corn as the first and third ingredients and the second being \""chicken-by-product meal\"". I usually try to stick with pet foods that have real meat as the first or second ingredient and avoid anything with \""by-products\"" or fillers, especially if it's listed in the first several ingredients of the food. As happy as I am he seems to be doing well on Beneful, I'd feel better about giving it to him if there was more pure meat and less corn, fillers and random by-products that aren't adding any significant value to his diet.5-stars for taste4-stars for how he's doing on the food4-stars for price2.5 stars for ingredient list""","Dog likes it, but ingredients could be better...",4

I just opened the new bag of dry food and the color and smell is completely different from the last order. Knowing that the Van Patten's took pride in their food quality and not sure how Del Monte's quality control is, we are switching to the Blue Buffalo brand. I do not want to put my babies at risk if the Del Monte co. is already struggling. Blue Buffalo is also grain free and good for dogs with allergies. Hopefully this change will work out. I just feel that I cannot trust this brand and seeing already how different the food looks, scares me.Update: March 2014After being on Blue Buffalo for a couple of months, my poor babies had really bad stomach issues. They had gas all the time and their stomachs gurgled all night and my boy starting the constant licking on his paws like he did on Paul Newman's food. The vet said that the food had to much protein and that it is hard to breakdown plus it is hard on the kidneys. After much thought, and with the Natural Balance being back in stock, we did the whole weaning process off Blue and back to Natural Balance. I have to say that their stomach issues are gone, the mess I pick up in the yard is not has gross and runny and overall they just seem better being back on this food. Thankfully, the itching has stopped as well. Hopefully they will not have production issues again and we can stay with this brand since I know it works.",New ownership - different look,2
3771,"""W. Dietrich \""WD\""""",It is hard to review a product that was meant for a dog but I will give it a try.  The first thing upon opening up the resealable package is that the treats are a little on the large size and seem to be meant to break in half as there is a line down the middle that allows you to snap in two.  These should not be considered training treats because they are much too big to feed to your dog several times a day.  I did smell them before giving them to the dogs and the smell seemed fresh and reminded me of a regular cookie which is what they resemble.Now for taste I left that to the dogs.  I have two dogs a Schipperkie and a Mini Aussie that are given treats twice a day plus training treats.  They only eat the finest products which are fresh from the dog bakery or a gourment dog treat store so it is safe to say the dogs are somewhat pickey.  When I first gave the treats they both took them from me and ran off to enjoy. Now it is important to note that when they get a really special treat they each go to there favorite place to enjoy and keep the other dog from stealing the treat.  In this case the dogs ate their treats next to each other so I am going to assume they did not feel that the treat was all that special.  Next I put the Newman Treat in the bowl with a cookie that smells like a pizza from the dog bakery.  One dog took the Newman cookie first and the other dog took the pizza cookie first which was smaller than the Newman treat.  The dogs digested the food properly after checking as the poop size was normal after a week of using the Newman product as their daily treats.All in all I wish the product was sold in a smaller size but the quality of the treat seemed to be good and the dogs liked the treats but I dont feel they loved them (as I mentioned before they did not go to their special place to eat the treats in piece and quite as they will do on their favorite treats).,Treat size is a little on the large size,4

Honeycatt come running the instant they hear the package opening no matter which of the five flavors I'm serving up that night: tuna, roasted chicken, ocean fish, salmon, or catnip. I've noticed recently that prices here for the 5.5 oz. bags vary a lot from flavor to flavor and sometimes also from day to day. For example, you can usually (but not always) find 5.5 oz. bags of Chicken Greenies for about $2.99 as an add on. The recently introduced 5.5 oz. Catnip flavor was selling here for over $10 a couple of  months ago but at this writing is in the $7+ range, while the fish flavors can usually be had for prices somewhere in between. I treated my cats to the new catnip flavor when it came out, curious to see if it'd be a bigger hit than the others (it wasn't) and if eating it would lead to stoned cat behavior (it didn't).

The only toy she has that has lasted more than a month or so is her original red Kong, which she mostly licks instead of chews.I initially bought the dinosaur for my other, less toy-murderous dog, but the power chewer quickly stole it from him.

I had been eyeing this product for about a year since I always felt bad in the warm summer months when we are on our back deck and our poor indoor cat has to watch from the other side of the screen door. The price never really decreased but before it started warming up, I decided to buy it to alleviate my guilt of keeping my cat indoors. When I got it, I opened it in the living room, realized it's quite large, and got my cat acclimated to it. A few days later, I opened it outdoors, unzipped the little entry, grabbed my cat and put her inside with some toys. She didn't care for it at all and sat in one corner and as soon as I unzipped it, she was dying to get out, which I was fine with because the end of the zipper broke and rendered the door useless! I'm not going to risk having my cat outside in this mesh tent with the defective door because if she figured out the door wasn't secured or if she walked/rubbed against it, she'd unzip it further, allowing her to escape outside! I am not going to risk losing my cat because of this low-quality item. So I contacted customer service, and they were nice enough to give me a prepaid label to ship it back. I shipped it back promptly and was surprised ~1.5 months later when I got an email that they were still waiting for the returned item!! I returned it to a UPS store a few days after they sent me the label and if they had written me sooner than 1.5 months later, I would still have the UPS drop-off receipt, but since it had been so long, I had throw away the receipt. This was my WORST Amazon purchase by far. They ripped me off twice since 1) the product was low-quality and 2) they asked me to ship it back in and then kept my money....not that I particularly wanted to have the broken crappy product for ~$35+ but it's probably better to have SOMETHING for my $35+ rather than nothing!","Cat didn't enjoy this, zipper broke and rendered it useless, and never refunded me since they claimed to have never received it!",1

Chinchillas also dont seem to like sleeping in the little hammock it comes with so a version that is also without the hammock would be better for chinchilla owners. Include a chinchilla wheel instead for the price of the useless ramps and hammock.","Came with broken parts, but good size for 2 chinchillas",3
3815,Elizabeth Higgins,"After reading a million reviews and deciding I was willing to spend a couple extra bucks for quality, waterproofing and (I believe) a Made in the USA product, I am SO glad I did! As soon as the box came, I could tell it was a well-made product and the packaging was professional. I've had this now for several weeks and I literally use it EVERY day with my 65lb pit-bull/ridgeback mix doggie. I had worked with him extensively on leash training but because he is so strong and determined, I ended up with tendonitis in my arm and it makes it painful to correct him. This collar has been such a godsend because I can allow him some freedom, which is great for both of us. I've only used the vibrate/shock on low settings and almost never even use it anymore because he's learned to come right back to me when I call him. Beauty! I don't believe in being lazy about dog training so I continually work with him without using the collar as a crutch, but having this option to snap him out of an obsession with squirrels, coyotes or whatever is absolutely necessary as I see it. Also, the collar and receiver hold the charge really well! In several weeks, I haven't had to charge it once yet.

3818,"""suzanne \""suzmoth\""""","""So far, So good - I've had it about a month (and I bought it on craigslist, in perfect condition for a very fair price). Like anything new in their environment, the cats were initially cautious, however, once they associated it with food(!), now they come right over when the hear the \""sound\"" or when I'm fiddling with it.I have two cats - V and L:L is fat and likes to eat and is not very athletic. This feeder is just for her and works perfectly for her. She has not even tried to bust it open, even though she sniffs it a little after I put the food in, she is satisfied that she cannot reach the food and wanders away. L is a very simple cat.My other cat V is thin and just a nibbler, and is very curious and athletic, her seperate, open food dish is up high, so L can't reach it, and so V can nibble all day. If I put V's food in this timed feeder, I have no doubt she would outsmart it and/or break it open in a day.Notes:*I found it easy to set.*Quiet, even in my small apt.(but I live in the city, which is noisy itself).*I found it straightforward to pop apart and add food, just pay attention to the compartments so they are lined up properly for re-assembly(ex: make sure you place food in the compartment that it will open to next).*It is a simple machine. The time settings are not very adjustable - 6, 12 hr, etc.*I use it for an extra feeding when I work long days(12+ hrs) - but I am not sure I'd rely on it alone for a long weekend, but seems fine for an overnight. I prefer a live person to check in on my cats and apt anyway when I'm away.*I use it for dry food only. I would definitely not use it for wet food.* Must stare at it until you see the green light flash, to check to see if it's actually \""on\"".* A little big, very round, so I put it under the chair or table in kitchen so L has easy access to opening slot.Overall, I found it worth my time & money.

From a human point of view the food looks good and smells fine,  but the packaging leaves something to be desired:  it's a tear open top and can't be resealed, so you have to find a clip to keep it closed. From our puppy's point of view this was a no go.  He just wouldn't eat it,  have no idea why.  We tried twice,  got no traction,  and so stopped.

When my little turds climb up into the turtle topper the friction between the bottom of their shells and the topper floor makes the loudest grinding plastic sound. It gets worse when my turtle slides down the ramp back into the water because it makes a VERY loud sound. It's not a huge deal and you get used to it, but when one of my guys slides down the ramp in the middle of the night it can scare the crap out of me.Like most have said, the suction cups that are supposed to keep the turtle topper in place are completely useless and do not stay on, but for me this hasn't been a big deal.

Overall design is good too, but my dog couldn't care less if it's shaped like a squirrel or not.

3824,Mrs. Kilo Delta,"""Let me start off by saying this collar works, and yet I've never pressed a button on the remote.I have 2 shetland sheepdogs (shelties).  The boy is pretty quiet, but the girl sheltie is a barker for sure.  My furry kids are indoor dogs, except for long walks in the park and potty breaks in the side yard where I watch over them (we're in a semi-rural area and have coyotes who injure/kill dogs much larger than mine).  Anyway, my girl sheltie will be resting quietly next to me, and the next moment she'll leap up barking loudly because she hears a neighborhood dog barking a mile away (startles the living daylights out of me) .  Same goes if she looks out the window and sees a squirrel a hundred feet away.  Sometimes I have no idea what she's barking at.  She loves to bark, as sheepdogs tend to do.  Playtime involves barking, she doesn't play if she isn't allowed to bark.  If I tell her \""No barking\"" sometimes she ignores me, and when she does listen, she looks at me forlornly like I've just declared, \""And no more happiness!\""  She is otherwise very well behaved.  The barking is the big issue.  Playing classical music all day helps, but sometimes she just gets into a barky mood despite the music.I didn't want an automatic bark collar because I was worried it would go off by accident when she didn't need correcting.  Plus, she has a long THICK double coat so I thought that the automatic bark collar just wouldn't work as it should.  After much shopping around and researching, I bought this Petsafe dog trainer collar.  I'm happy to say, when she gets in a barky mood all I have to do is put this collar on her and she's not interested in barking at every little thing anymore.  I don't have to do anything with the remote.  It's mostly because she hates collars in general.  She's fine with her I.D. collar (she forgets that she has it on), but if I put a loose slip lead on her, like, really loose, she throws herself on the floor and rubs her neck around like it's the most terrible thing ever.  I put this dog trainer collar on her pretty loose... I think the directions say to leave room for two fingers, but I put it on loosely enough that I can easily fit both hands under it.  But she doesn't like it, and her barky moods are far fewer in number so maybe once a month I have to use the collar on her to remind her that barkiness=collar.So it works for me, though other people will probably have to use the remote.  =)What I don't like:  Whatever the collar itself is made of, I hate it.  It's this plastic-like material that grabs on her long fur when I put it on, causing her fur to snag in the buckle closure.  It's just a pain in the patootie to put it on her without pulling her fur, so I'm glad I don't have to use it very often.  I wish it had a fabric collar with a snap-lock closure for ease of putting it on.Also, the description said it came with a \""lanyard\"" and the photo showed what appeared to be a sturdy neck lanyard.  However, mine came with a thin, flimsy wrist lanyard.  I didn't care for it as the remote would be flailing about my wrist as I moved about the house doing whatever I needed to do, so I put the remote on an old neck lanyard we had.""",Good deterrent - hate whatever the collar itself is made of,4

They are in a very large cage and I have been using Carefresh and others like it trying to find one that helps with odor. The cage corners are scooped out 2 times a week as this is were they potty with fresh bedding added. Still the odor can be smelled even before you get to the door of the room.  I bought a bag of this to try at a local pet store. I got 1 that was the one shown & 1 with the lavender in it.  I have to say that this stuff works really well.  The feces & urine are dried out in no time and this is day number 4 with no odor. I add the lavender one just to the corners for an extra scent to help. I went to scoop the cage today and to my surprise it was completely odorless and everything (corners & all) were dry.I have seen where others have said that it is messy & kicked out of the cage.  Well I had to use a shop vac to clean up the floor with the Carefresh because it would stop up a reg. vac.  I have yet to find any of this in the floor.  I take my scooper & spread it out evenly every other day.  The piggies seem to love it and their cage not only had been odor free but looks so much nicer & cleaner too.

When you throw away the cartridge, your also throwing away the good bacteria that helps keep your tank clean and is beneficial to the fish living in your tank. The biological or what they call biological is a plastic sleeve that the mechanical and chemical cartridge sits in. If it gets gummed up or dirty, you wash it. Your also washing off all the good beneficial stull that took so long to get that helps the health and cleaning of the tank. The wet/dry part is another useless peace of plastic. Again, after use it builds up slime and other beneficial bacteria that gets washed off when cleaning the filter housing.

The kibbles help scrub the dogs teach to reduce plaque buildup as well, and keep their breath clean.IAMs dog food is enriched with antioxidants to help maintain a strong immune system and firm muscles. It has 7 essential nutrients as well. One of our dogs has a sensitive tummy, and they did throw up on this food... for them, a more all natural, corn free, etc food works best and works with their tummy. For our other dogs, this food has been fine. No issues and they tried it for the past month. As far as &#34;seeing&#34; a difference in them, I can't say we have, they are happy healthy dogs. So you can say IAMS continued to do a great job keeping our dogs happy and healthy without any issues:)","Good Food, Dogs Enjoy it,",4

3880,T. Harris,"""I've owned a LitterMaid for the last 6 or 7 years.  These units are generally reliable.  The biggest benefit is the odor control.  The dirty stuff is raked into a plastic catch-bin that has a lid.  The smell is kept to a minimum, until the catch-bin is too full and the lid doesn't close fully.My first LitterMaid's retractable power cord (on the rake) stopped recoiling into the unit, so it eventually got snagged on the rake, and it broke.  That was after more than 3 years of use.  Not bad for a product that runs at least 10-15 times a day (I've got 2 cats).  My second LitterMaid has been going strong since I replaced the last one well over 2 years ago.The most important thing I can suggest is using *premium* clumping litter.  I've been very happy with the ScoopAway brand.  Cheap litter breaks apart and makes a mess.  The next thing is to keep the litter level below the \""max fill\"" line.  Too much litter causes the rake to bog down.  Also, cooking oil spray (pam) works very well to keep the clumps from sticking to the bottom.I use the \""disposable\"" catch pans over and over until they crack.  I can normally get 2 or 3 months before I consider changing it out.  I can't imagine tossing it out after one filling.  That's a big expense, and a waste of money and a perfectly operable item.  I don't use a liner/bag in the catch.  Just dump the dirty stuff into a bag and out to the trash.  I have two cats and they can fill the catch-bin in 2 to 3 days.  Normally, I just dump the bin, use a scoop to quickly get the smaller bits missed by the rake, and that's it.  I have gone well over 6 months before doing any major cleaning of the box.If you have more than one cat, I would get the \""Mega\"" model, since it is bigger.  The new Advanced model isn't getting good reviews here at Amazon, so I would keep away from that unit.The LitterMaids are a bit noisy.  That maybe the biggest drawback.  Also, it is not a perfect cleaner, and will leave little bits that need to be scooped by hand every few days.  There are times when litter will build up in the back of the pan, and the rake will cycle over and over until you level things off (this can mostly be avoided by not filling to the top fill line).  It takes a few weeks to work out all the kinks, but once you do, you will love it.I will always own a LitterMaid because it keeps the house smelling like we don't have cats.""",Does the job,5
3881,B. CAIN,"""I'm a huge fan of the Da Bird cat toys. I preach them like they are a religion!!But I'm not a fan AT ALL of this 2-piece pole.I bought the 1-piece pole for my cats and it's awesome. AWESOME. The best cat toy ever. My cats are obsessed with it and it's great exercise. They wear themselves out and then sleep and don't get into other mischief. So -- GREAT FIVE STAR TOY.But in my opinion, you should get the 1-piece pole. I bought the 2-part pole at a local pet store (the only model they had) for a friend I was cat-sitting for.Several times while playing with the toy, the pole would come apart in the middle of play. If the cat grabbed the toy hard at all, the pole just came part. I didn't return it -- just left a note with my friend that she'll need to reinforce the pole with some duct tape.It also seems like the 2-part poles come with different kinds of feathers. The feather toy on the 2-pc pole is longer and red (or pink) instead of the brown & white guinea feathers that come with the 1-part pole. I tried both kinds with my cats and they like them both, but like the brown & white feathers best.But the feathers are fine. It's the pole that sucks. I'm sure the 2-pc pole is easier and cheaper to ship, which makes me think it'd be cheaper. But here on Amazon at least, the 2pc pole costs more. There needs to be some kind of \""lock\"" once you assemble the pole, but there's nothing.Just get the 1-pc pole. Do it! Your cat will love it!!""",Great toy - do NOT like 2-part pole,3

3890,StillWaters,"""I love this litter because...1. It completely eliminates urine odor. It doesn't smell like a litter box typically does (like clay, urine and feces). Feces do smell right after your cat uses the box, but this goes away. The idea that a cat litter is going to eliminate feces odor right when the cat goes doesn't make sense to me...it would have to be loaded with chemicals and perfumes, which I don't want. The odor goes away within a few minutes, and I just scoop out feces at the end of the day.2. It is very inexpensive. You only fill the box a small amount, unlike clay litters. I use it along with the Feline Pine Self cleaning litter box, and this is the best value. I only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a YEAR.3. It does not track nearly as bad as clay or other fine grained litters4. Biodegradable materialsWhat would you rather have, a litter box with 3 or 4 inches of clay litter that starts smelling after only a couple of days and is disgusting and must be trashed by the end of the week, or an inch of Feline Pine, that does not smell and lasts for 2 weeks before needing to be changed? I almost want to laugh when I go to people's houses and I see their disgusting clay litter boxes, or see people buying clay litter at the store. Don't they know there's a way that is not only better for the environment, but doesn't smell and is a better value?I would also like to note that my cat is one of those picky sensitive cats that will not use litters with a lot of perfume or with a texture she doesn't like. I purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them, but she ok with the Feline Pine pellets.To those who are saying FP is a \""poor value\"" because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same, first of all I have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same. I also don't understand why it is even an issue, considering that FP is cheaper than clay cat litters and works better. Personally I like shopping for cat litter and knowing that I am supporting a good environmentally friendly company, rather than a company that makes clay litter loaded with perfumes and chemicals.Note about the price: I don't recommend buying it here on Amazon. At most stores you can get a 20 lb bag for only $10, I have even seen them on sale for $8. I would never pay what Amazon is asking here.""",This is all I ever use anymore,5

He dived right in, and ate the whole thing. I like how the bite size is much smaller than the Friskie's, and it contains good amount of juice/gravy that is not too thick (although it might be oil:/). I don't know whether it's oil or juice or gravy as long as my cats love it. I am still trying out this food for my cats, and so far I don't notice any discomfort in them after eating. I guess that's always a good sign! I mean if Friskie's doesn't bring back the previous price to their products, I will just stick with Whiskas.",So far so good,4

And for some reason, they don't seem as afraid of this carrier as they were of the old plastic carrier we had. I think it helps that the top opens and they can go in from the top. (The front / side also opens so they can enter that way.)The first time we used it, Kitty peed in there while in transit to the vet. Oops! Even after washing the removable &#34;fleece&#34; pad, it still smelled really bad inside the carrier. I wiped it out good and sprayed many applications of that Miracle spray in it over a period of a couple weeks. It seemed like the smell was gone, so I put the carrier into the closet where I keep them. Opened the closet a few days later &#8211; whew! Just cannot get rid of that smell.

They walk nicely individually but when together pulling was a problem. It did help lessen the pulling but the number of times this tool was confused with a muzzle just broke our hearts...people saw only the straps, not the friendly well-behaved dog inside it. When you own a breed endlessly maligned in the media and largely misunderstood you find yourself doing everything you can to avoid further mistaken negativity.Instead, we just started back at zero and re-taught proper walking with another dog just as we had when she was by herself.The dog we continued using the headcollar with did fine but not when we tried to transition to a martingale collar when he grew out of the Gentle Leader. Without the Head Collar, all bets were off and he acted as if he didn't know any leash manners at all! So we had to start at the beginning and retrain him to walk correctly with only his collar when with other dogs, too.The Premier Head Collar is a highly effective tool, it just wasn't quite right for our situations. To avoid the same negativity issues with our new youngsters but obtain the same principles of control (turning the dog when it pulls and having excellent control in excitable situations as they learn good leash manners) we used the Premier Easy Walk harness--clipped to their martingale collars for extra safety, since athletic and determined dogs can wriggle out of the harness. They have transitioned from use of the harness to just their collars as they get older with none of the problems we had trying to transition from Head Collar to martingale only. This was probably entirely our fault but others might have had the same issues, too.",works well but not right for us,3

The sturdiness of the just the plastic tabs connecting the top and bottom half is good I feel, although my father doesn't trust the strength of them.  But, for security, there are also screw holes--if you want the top and bottom connected semi-permanently, or want it to pass airline regulations.I've received compliments on the carrier from multiple people--including my cats' vet.  The color is cute.  My only real dislike is that I'm not a huge fan of the way the door is secured closed, as it feels kinda of cheap and difficult to close/open (although, on that note I suppose no cat is going to be able to open it up, and there are no separate/losable pieces involved).  I feel there are better options for that on the market.The top little 'doors' are nice, albeit with just a plastic folding hinge.  The opening one is a bit too big, as you cannot leave it open, since it's just big enough for a cat to stick its head through, and I could imagine a cat getting stuck consequently.As far as the size, yes, it is pretty small.  I have two cats--6lbs and 8.5 lbs, and each fits in it perfectly fine (not at the same time of course).  They're unable to stand fully up in it, but have plenty of room to move around.

I have been using the Forever Litter Tray for at least 2 years.  Those alone have saved me major dollars compared to buying the original disposable trays.  Having used the original trays and buying them in a 3 pack when I could, I know what I'm talking about when I speak of saving money.Having said that, this liner will make those disposable trays be a lot less disposable and more permanent whereas you can save some dollars and buy your crystal litter separately.  Have an opinion on that too, check out Just the Crystals, you can order here at Amazon and qualify for free shipping as well.Back to the Crystal Liners...in my opinion, these Crystal liners are superior to the bulk cardboard type that I've seen at stores such as Pet Co, and here on line.  They are molded as one piece making cleanup very easy.I would absolutely recommend these for the Scoop Free Trays as the Forever Tray is not available for legal reasons.  Those who already have the Forever Tray, these Crystal Liners will save you even more time when changing the box.So, bottom line, $$ and time are saved with these Crystal Liners if you are using the Scoop Free Trays, and if you have a Forever Tray, time will be noticeably less spent changing out the old for the new litter.",Beta Tested Crystal Litter Liners,5

3985,"""Techthusiast \""n00b\""""","I grew more and more suspicious of all the dust tracking from artificial litter and more and more intrigued by the idea of actually being able to compost Feline Pine. The litter boxes are in my bedroom and walking on gray kitty litter just was too much after awhile. I dumped a bunch of the gray stuff in her box one day, plumes of dust came up, and that was just about the end of that.I actually got the pellet version of Feline Pine for a long time but like the clumping better.Yes, the pellet kind didn't track and I had even gotten two of their litter pans with a grate ...in that version, the pellets disintegrate when urinated on and the idea is that the disintegrated parts settle through the grate into a lower pan... great idea.... but my cat loves water soooo much that she is a pee-machine. It was impossible to keep up with the pellet version without it starting to smell up my bedroom.I think it can and does work for lots of people but once I saw how this clumping kind was going to work, I was sold. I think I probably used it with the pellet kind at first as a sort of secondary absorber ...and then discovered that it did an incredible job of absorbing pee and pee smell..... so that was a huge win ... I mean, my bedroom just isn't that big!To that end, my cat does not cover her poo with litter -- if she did, I don't think I would smell it ;) But she doesn't. I just don't think it's in her personality or training ;) Of course, for all I know, some other consistency of litter would invite coverage but, bottom-line, her s*** stinks.Solution? Well since the problem is really at night-time you don't want poop to enter your dreams ;) So I don't feed her anything that will come out stinky at night, for starters. But I confess I did get a cheap air purifier and put it on a timer for awhile there when she was crapping exclusively at night....it worked splendidly actually so I kinda became sold on purifiers too lol.I know, I'm not really helping.I'm just saying, if your cat doesn't cover their poop up, this litter isn't going to work miracles.I scoop it out and flush it down the toilet...then I keep used bread/chip/etc bags around and shovel the clumps in... I recommend the the scoop with huge slots because it will let the good dry stuff sift back into the pan....eventually I'll get to composting -- I've dumped some of this clumping kind in with soil and it seemed to be kinda awesome. Definitely seems rich ;)But yeah, tracking... it's significant. I mean, so does the fake stuff but this doesn't feel as gross/horrible to be walking on a little sawdust... in a weird way, you know that if your cat tracked it, it probably wasn't peed on... it's dry particles.Still.Anyway, my current solution is that I got a big tray that would go in a dog crate and put that under the litter boxes (I have two for her..like I said, she's a pee machine) ... this handles the first wave of tracking...

Of course, I'm not sure if the differences should be seen right away or not. I am hesitant to use this as there seems to be varying opinions on what this does to plecos, of which I have 3. I don't want to kill them, but at the same time, I want to treat my water. I used the recommended dosage last week and so far all my little plecos are still swimming around just fine.

I also couldn't figure out how some of them were supposed to go on!I decided to try this harness vest and it seems to work best.  I looked at the size chart and got him the extra small, but it is a little big.  I can adjust it so it fits reasonably well.  It is also very secure with the Velcro around the neck and around the chest, so he can't get out of it.  I like how simple it is to put on, and of course how stylish he looks!

3993,Sharon O. Wood,"Using replaceable cartridges like this can be expensive but buying them in bulk like this saved us money. These cartridges are very easy to work with and to insert into the LitterLocker II. I've see other reviews that say that you can use cheaper &#34;kitchen&#34; bags and stuff them into the edges of one of these used cartridges but I really like the ease of how these work.The process is so easy. Take a new cartridge, remove the plastic protective ring on the cartridge starting with the easily identifiable tab. Pull out a small amount of the edge of the bag all around. Open the LitterLocker II lid and the top part with the hole. You'll see the shelf that this cartridge sits on. Drop the cartridge bag edge facing down into the cartridge space and close the top and the lid.Next, open the Litter Locker in the middle by the Spring Loaded Barrier and you'll see the bag edges right there. Take hold of the edges of the bag and gently pull down until you have enough of the material to make a bag that will fit to the bottom of the Litter Locker plus an bit more to make the knot. Tie a knot in the bottom of the bag and close it all up.To save on bags I take one extra step. I open the lid of the closed LitterLocker, hold open the Spring Loaded Barrier and push the newly tied bag down to the bottom of the container to assure that it is fully open. I found that if you don't do this the first used litter contribution can stick halfway down the bag and when you go to change the bag there will be a strip of unfilled bag under the used litter. It's a small thing but it will save you money on bags in the end and only takes a few seconds more. After this process you can keep adding used litter to the canister by just opening the lid, making the deposit and opening the Spring Loaded Barrier to let the used litter fall to the bottom and be closed off. We have 4 cats one of which is a 21 lb Maine Coon so we have a lot of used litter and one of these cartridges lasts almost a month. Not bad.The only &#34;Con&#34; is that the bag material is just a little bit thin so be careful when you are changing out the old bag that you don't drop it too hard on the floor or get it caught on something as you will end up with messy used kitty litter on the floor. Even with this &#34;con&#34; the whole system is so neat and easy to use that I don't mind take extra caution with the thinner bags.",Works very well with our LitterLocker II,5

3996,KatieKat,"I have a four year old dog who loves Pedigree Canned Dog food.  We have been using it the last six months.  I have purchased some of the most expensive canned dog foods at a local pet store and he will not eat the stuff.  If I have a bag of high quality kibbles and mix it in with the Pedigree, he will not eat his food.  We tried Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Holistic Select, Innova, Merrick, and Natural Balance.  I don't know what is in these higher quality cans of dog food he does not like.  Maybe too many vegetables??  He will even hide and pout if I put that stuff in front of him.  One time I left the food out for 15 min., put it away, and tried the next day.  He just would not eat the food.  He just loves the smell and taste of Pedigree, and he will even eat Alpo on occasion, but he will not eat the expensive dog foods, which I am more than willing to purchase for him.  I talked to two vets about this.  They tell me dogs go by odor.  The worse something smells the more they like it.  This is why many dogs will roll in dead things out of doors.  We do try to balance out his diets with apples, carrots, etc., if he will eat them, plus the dog gets a vitamin with minerals each day.  Of course he will eat cooked meat if I give it to him, and often we will give this to him with some rice or whole wheat pasta mixed in.  If someone can tell me how to get him to eat the better canned or kibble dog food that so many folks think dogs should be on, then I would like to know this.  Also, the reason we started using Pedigree is because we have some friends (and their relatives) who have had many dogs over the years and feed them Pedigree.  These dogs have lived to a ripe old age.  The biggest thing that got them down was arthritis, but the Pedigree never killed them.  So, this dog food may not be high quality, which I agree when compared to Blue Buffalo, etc., but it does not seem to affect their life span.  I am sure there will be folks who will tell me differently, but for those folks I know personally, they have not found any problems with this food for their dogs.

It was just that our dogs fur wasn't allowing contact with the skin and thus he wouldn't get the zap.  I don't want to rate it too poorly because I could have probably trimmed the fur around the neck a bit, but didn't want to.  we got this primarily to help with poop-eating, and if it wasn't going to work 100% of the time, it wasn't going to be effective, so it's sitting in the basement.  I'm sure with a different dog, it would work great, but again, things like this are only effective as the user.Upon trying this on my arm to see how bad the shock was I was surprised that I could barely feel it up to 4 or 5 (out of 10) and I never went above 8 on myself, but it didn't hurt.

He was having a very difficut time getting up from his bed or anywhere he chose to lie down. I took him to a vet and he was prescribed glucosamine. This medication made him so sick I thought he was going to die. I took him to a different vet who told me about the hip and joint problem. She replaced the glucosamine with four different prescriptions and he got somewhat better but still had a difficult time getting up.When I saw the contents of Missing Link Ultimate my first reaction was to decline a purchase because of the glucosamine. But, if it could help I decided to give it a try and would keep the dosage very small. I decided that if I saw any negative reaction to this product at all I would immediately discontinue its use. The recommended dosage for my large Dobie calls for 4 teaspoons. I started off with just one teaspoon. After seeing no ill effects I gradually increased the dosage until I am now at the recommended 4 teaspoons. The results are absolutely amazing. He can get up without the agony he had previously. There are times when he just leaps up with no problem. There are also times when it is obvious that he is not at the top of his game but neither is he in the deplorable condition as before this product was administered.When your pet is hurting it is a heart-wrenching sight to watch. Although I cannot claim that my Dobie is back to normal at least he is able to get around without experiencing the previous terrible discomfort and agony.

Being scientifically accurate, I brought four dogs to the (figurative) table:  two Rat Terriers (Riley and Hawk), a Doberman (Halle), and a Brown Lab (Polo).For testing purposes, I (really, I did!) set out four bowls.  My idea was to let each of them take a choice of the four:  Beneful by Purina (this product), Chef Michael's Sirloin (fancy stuff), Kirkland Lamb & Rice (their regular food), and strangely enough, dry cat food which seems to be a hit with all of them (they obsess over it).Each dog had a turn.  I'm not sure if it was the look of it, because it looks like a real pot roast dinner, but Chef Michael got woofed down the fastest.  They didn't even look at the Beneful or others.  I don't think dogs see in color, so am convinced it wasn't the colorful kibbles.  My testing problem was that trying to take each dog away and put them aside to let the other dogs have a turn at the taste test was fraught with danger. They did NOT want to give up the CM.  The Kirkland and the Beneful didn't warrant any interest, even when Chef Michael's was gone and those were the only options.  The Beneful was the most colorful and interesting \""looking\"", but it didn't make them appear interested. Even the cat food that they usually go for (probably just to get on the cat's nerves) sat unnibbled.As far as the next day, there was leftover Beneful, so the blue jays that look for freebies were checking it out. They liked it.  I don't think it's a bad dog food, but given the options, they were just not interested in Beneful (although I like the commercials!).One thing that bugged me (slightly) was that I was told that both corn and oatmeal make dogs coats itch...not sure if that's true, but Beneful seems to make a big deal out of their veggie ingredients.  Dogs are carnivores.  I couldn't help but think maybe the bag and advertising was intended to impress people with the ingredients, rather than the dogs.  They've been eating this since the Chef Michael ran out, and I didn't notice any itching, and I also didn't notice too much doggy doo-doo, which often is excessive with cheap dog food.  So I would think it's a quality product, just not in comparison.An unexpected treat is that when you order dog food online, if it's Prime shipping it shows up quick and shipped free...so no lugging it from the store.  I like that convenience of that, and plan on putting dog food on a subscription plan on Amazon so that I don't have to run out when when we frequently run out.""",Nothing special...dogs weren't impressed,3

4088,Tom D,"One star off a bit reluctantly because it wasn't 100% effective immediately.Fleas are tenacious little buggers.  We have two, long haired dogs.  It's tough to see the fleas on furniture or in carpet, easier to find them on the dogs.  In the past, Frontline Plus seemed to control or prevent the problem and prevent a house infestation, but not this year. Maybe it was the dry weather. It was a battle.  We tried over the counter flea bombs, two brands; someplace between  immeasurably marginal and a total waste of money.Based on the vet's recommendation, we tried the canned aerosol and this pump sprayer.  Either is OK, more for your money with the pump sprayer. Also used a sticky paper Victor Ultimate Flea Trap (Amazon), but we use the flea trap more as a measure of how bad the infestation is; it will not solve the problem. Count the fleas trapped in 24 hours, when it gets down to 1 or 2 you just about have things under control. Zero and you can break out the champagne.The Siphotrol products seem to be largely effective immediately.  The label says it kills adult fleas on contact and I won't argue with that but the critters seem to hide or hatch continuously.  It certainly knocks down the population but it takes another week or so to eliminate the problem.  It did not require a second application.  Also, if you've chased fleas you know they're fast and elusive, but after the Siphotrol, if they're still living they're pretty lethargic.We used the Siphotrol product on the carpet and furniture, and Barklogic's Lemongrass Tick and Flea Pet Wash (Amazon) on the dogs, one application each and the problem was maybe 90+% resolved the first day, stragglers gone within a week.  The Siphotrol has almost no smell, nothing residual. Though the dogs love to swim, they have always loathed a bath.  FWIW there's something about this Lemongrass product that they both liked, very mild, pleasant aroma and you could see the fleas going down the drain.","Effective, Mostly Immediately, 100% Takes Longer, Good Stuff",4

I was hoping I could use it when my arms were tired, but it is not at all comfortable to hold the button to light it down. It's fairly finger intensive for someone with sore digits much of the time. May work for other cats, but not for mine.Doesn't work for what I needed, so if you need an easy toy, at least get one that doesn't need to be pushed constantly to light up.","Being generous, it is just ok.",2

I don't like bathing him too frequently because of the effect it has on his skin, but I was tired of having that dog smell linger on the house. Tried this out, it covers up the smell awhile. He smells like the cologne for about a few days and the 'dog' smell doesn't come back for about a week.I am not that crazy about the smell of the cologne itself, but I do know that they sell different scents, so I might try one of them.

4110,"""Neil E Howell \""Howeln\""""","I have read a number of reviews that were negative and wanted to leave my positive experiences over the last 6 years of having the fogger, I would recommend this with only limited reservations, or more specifically user notes (listed at the end of this review).  I also have hard well water, so I use our RO water to fill the bottles.I have now owned four of them, two currently in use and two failed over time.  I have each of them on a zoo med hygrotherm to control the humidity level, now for two enclosures.  While they do not last forever, I have had them last a least 3 years each time.  The fogger runs daily, but not constant.I have one enclosure at 80% humidity (poison dart frogs) with a 1 liter bottle, and one at 60% humidity (ball python) with a 2 liter bottle, and I live in Southern California where the humidity gets into the single digits on occasion.  The units come on every half to 1 hour for awhile....something like that.  It varies of course, but they are cycled quite a bit, and work consistently...i.e. I don't even think about them, other than to check water levels.The fogger will automatically shut off when there is not enough water.  And refilling is easy. The top that screws onto the bottle uses a plunger to let water in, which nearly eliminates the chance of spilling water.There is a control knob to limit how much fog is put out, from basically off, to quite a bit.A half inch PVC pipe (I believe) can be used to extend the fogger pipe if needed, though it will only go so far.  I use it to extend/stiffen the pipe to the enclosure.Limited reservations:  basically, things to keep in mind for setup and useI have had one die within a week of receiving it, but was promptly replaced (just recently, and the next two bought have been working fine for 3 months now).  My other two lasted at least three years each.  This last one seemed to fail to turn off when the water ran out, or more specifically, not turn back on.  I would suggest half filling the bottle a couple of times and let it run all the way down, and verify when it's refilled that it comes back on.  I'm curious if this may be the early failures after a month or two.  BTW, mine typically runs out before I refill it, so I think the issue is either there, or not when you get a new unit.  1 of 5 is not a great failure rate, but with Amazons return policy, it's not a big deal for me.I highly recommend a zoo med hygrotherm, its a little pricey, but controls the temp and humidity levels perfectly.Also, the reservoir is not very large, but the one liter bottle it comes with can be swapped for a standard soda 2 liter.Of note, the top that screws onto the bottle has a plunger to let water out.  If you don't set the bottle reasonably straight down, the plunger can get cocked sideways and not let water out.  Pulling the bottle back out, moving the plunger back over, and resetting it more straight eliminate this issue.  I have one fogger that is almost arm length away from my access point, so placing the bottle back is a blind effort, but only a couple times a year do I end up cocking the plunger over.The unit does need to be fairly level, as the water level is very high in the reservoir...more of an issue when moving it, than when in place.The expanding pipe that comes with it is ridged, which can store water.  If positioned incorrectly, the water could block the fog.  Make sure water can run back down into the fogger, or into the enclosure....i.e. no dips.When it does start to burn out, it makes a bit of noise and little fog comes out...and stops intermittently.  In a pinch until the new one arrives, it can be tapped a bit hard and it will run for awhile.","Works very well, at least for a couple years from my exp.",5

Since it's so stiff and sturdy, it doesn't have any give so my dog just bit chunks of it off.

But my puppy was young, so I thought I might need to train him to use the bed. With a little more coaxing and encouragement, I finally got my puppy to stay off the couch and love his new bed. He doesn't seem to mind sinking in at all. Now he runs to his bed whenever I give him a toy and he loves to take out his toys one by one and place them on his bed. My puppy is only 25 lbs, but I got the large so he could grow into it. He has PLENTY of room to spare now and the cat has room to snuggle up in the corner of the bed as well.

4142,Samuel Chell,"""Although Amazon Prime is still over a hundred, it's priced lower than what I paid a couple of  weeks ago. Previous to this one, my two adult cats enjoyed the one at half the price (Go Pet Club Cat Tree Beige Color).  It's a great introductory tree--if you can anchor it to the floor.  Soon my cats were toppling the entire structure on a regular basis.  The pictured one, however, has a much wider base and is, overall, better balanced and more stable.As others have mentioned, it's essential to tighten all parts to the max.  I regret not applying some extra muscle to the parts assembled by my wife, because the highest platform broke loose on the second day when my heavy black cat jumped up to its surface. I have yet to test the company's responsiveness to a request for another platform.  In the meantime, my cats are quite content with two platforms instead of three.Compared to the less expensive tree, this one has wider platforms with ledges, and my cats obviously take to them more than the smaller, plainer platforms, remaining content to sleep on them or to simply survey the curious humans below for hours at a time.  Moreover, I'm finding that the previous, smaller and lower tree still can be used productively, since cats are more than bird-catchers: they enjoy \""flying\""--from one vertiginous precipice to the next.  But expect to hear the sound of periodic thunderous crashes--unless you're able to anchor the bases securely.Of course, there are parts that go unused, making me wonder if the manufacturer actually tested these cat attractions with real cats.  Neither of my cats (one a runt) ever used the lower enclosed part on the earlier model.  On the this model, they've ignored both ladders altogether (may as well toss the lower one), and only the higher, smaller enclosure has occasionally seen some occupancy.I've owned 10 cats (or vice versa), but most were obtained as kittens, which I was able to convince were dogs.

The Nutrience Grain Free is perfect for them because of the small size pellets and the wonderful ingredients packed into those pellets.  I think my cats fall into the food sensitivity category.

There is minimum water level indicator near the top, if you keep the temp knob partially out of the water & the water goes under this line then the heater will turn off.

They also have no-slip dots on the back so they're safe on all sorts of surfaces (top of a box, on top of a suitcase - a favorite sleeping spot, on a leather chair - protects the leather and provides a nice sleeping spot).A great buy.

The noise is not consitent or predictable but can be annoying.Some cats do prefer to drink from a running stream of water and if there was a drinking fountain that solved the above two problems I'd be prepared to try it.,Hard to keep clean,2

He loves to chase after it if I throw it and will spend a lot of time shaking and wrestling with it.  Unfortunately I've learned it's a toy that he can only play with under supervision.  He loves to chew and I found that within a matter of a few days he had chewed one of the feet off and was proceeding to try to eat the stuffing out of the center of the toy.  I still let him play with it but only for small intervals at a time and only if I can watch him.  The bottom line is this, it's a fun toy but no more durable than your average dog toy.  If your dog destroys your average toy chances are he'll chew through this as well.  It's great when I can watch him but for unsupervised play I'll only leave him with something like a kong or aEverlasting Treat Ball Large.

However, when we moved to a new location we came across this brand and I instantly fell in love. All you really need to do it read the ingredients in the back. Practically, everything that you would see a cat eat in the wild is in the food. There is real meat and fish in there, blueberries, cranberries and vegetables as well. I noticed a HUGE change in my cats. My oldest used to be real lethargic, always laying around sleeping, taking a few practice jumps before jumping up on the couch. Not to mention she had very bad dandruff. She's a tortoise shell and you could clearly see the dandruff without being right on top of her. Once I switched to Blue Buffalo, she got a little pep in her step. Now I find her running around the house like a bat out of hell and neither of my other two cats know what the heck is going on. Her coat is also nice, shiny and dandruff free. I never knew how much of a difference the change in food could be for her. Now she jumps up on the couch and bed (which is higher up) with ease and is even initiating play with my other two cats. She was the one cat that I'd noticed a dramatic change in. I highly recommend this brand to everyone. It gave me my childhood friend back.It may be more expensive than your average cat food but it is well worth it in the end. I have found no problem with my cats not liking this food. All three of them gobble up the food in their bowls as if they were rottweilers.*I recently had to switch to a low protein diet due to my eldest developing kidney disease. Within a month of switching foods she reverted back to having horrible dandruff. Aside from switching away from Blue Buffalo nothing in her diet/environment has changed.

My vet began by recommending that I applyEnisyl-F (L-Lysine) Nutritional Supplement for Cats, Metered Dose Pump 100 mLby squeezing an inch-long amount out of the packaging, a pump, as a supplement to put on food. The idea is that the L-Lysine, an amino acid, helps subdue the virus replication and thuys the symptoms, notes the manufacturer.Olivia did not like this strange stuff on her food, and further disliked having a 1-inch smear of it placed on her shoulder to lick off her fur.So as a replacement, when the paste ran out, I orderedEnisyl-F Lysine Treats  for Cats, 6.35oz, chicken flavor, from Amazon.com LINK -- bingo! She loves these treats and happily eats the recommended six a day to provide 250 mg of L-lysine during flareups, which I determine by noting if she sounds congested in her breathing or acts sniffly.Now comes along Pet Naturals version of L-Lysine chews, in a pack of 60 chicken liver flavors. A single chew contains 250 mg.Olivia seems to love Pet Naturals even more, and even the dog is agitated to smell the liver flavor and begs for a treat (he is not getting one!).From what I can tell, either product seems to indeed lessen the outbreak and reduce the symptoms for a week or so.A comparison of cost per 250 mg dose based on current prices:Enisyl-F Lysine Treats  /  Pet Naturals L-LysineWeight:  6.35 oz /  3.5 oz. *# Chews:  120  / 60Treatment Days per Bag:  20 / 60Cost overall:  $14-$17  / $5Cost per treatment day **:  $0.77 / $0.08Resealable Bag:  Yes  / YesCat Eagerness to Eat:  Very very high / Very highShape: Fish, medium size / Round, smallOdor: Pronounced / Milder* Unofficial weight not from manufacturer, based on my weighing the bag, which already had about five chews removed and eaten (to counteract the weight of the back itself)** Double-check the effect of shipping costs on this treat -- Pet Naturals may cost another $5 to ship at this time of writing, while Enisyl may qualify for Free Supersaver Shipping with additional items to make up $25.Pet Naturals of Vermont lists the following ingredients:* chicken, liver flavor, starch, L-Lysine, water, soy lecithin, canola oil, brewer's yeast, glycerin, oat flour, barley flour, rye flour, oat meal, calcium sulfate, maltodextrin, sodium alginate, sorbic acid, propionic acid (a preservative) and mixed tocopherol blend (a preservative).This compares to this ingredient list for Enisyl's version, which seems roughly comparable in terms of kicking off with meat:* poultry meal, rice flour, corn flour, L-lysine monohydrochloride, sugar, salt, potassium sorbate, titanium dioxide.Have fun -- try both if you like -- they really help Kitty out. My conclusion: Pet Naturals is more affordable than Enisyl, and both are better in terms of application and not making an enemy of your cat than the paste. It remains to be seen if Enisyl is more effective than Pet Naturals; that will take time to observe, and perhaps other reviewers can help.",Cheaper than other chews! & an excellent means of delivering L-lysine to cats with herpesvirus,5

The taller design works very well.  This fountain does not have a \""stream\"" of water but a gentle \""rolling\"" type surface.  This fountain does not splash or leak.  As a matter of fact, there is no way it can leak.  No worries about it \""spilling\"" out all over the place.  Just fill to the waterline and you are set.  Very quiet.  I keep it on the counter in my bathroom and I only hear it when I go in there.  If you are thinking about a fountain for your kitties or small dogs, this one is reliable, quiet, has gentle water movement (not scary to pets) and is easy to take apart and clean when needed.  If your pets have never used a fountain before, do not force them.  Set it up so they can reach it easily and let them investigate and get a feel for this gently moving water source.  I kept my cats normal drinking bowl in place so if he wouldn't use the fountain, he would not become dehydrated.  It took a few days but now my big maine coon cat jumps right up on the basin and gets himself a cool refreshing drink from his fountain.

I mash the tablets and mix them into her meals and she ddoesn't seem to notice, however mashing the tablets and dosing the food, although not a huge effort, was quickly replaced with these biscuits once I found my dog actually likes the biscuits.I too found many broken biscuits, however I toss the broken bits into a meal and my dog thinks she's struck gold (she'll dig the bit out from the bowl, race down the hallway as if to hide the find from me while she gobbles it up, then return to finish her meal).My vet recommended glucosamine as a preventive measure for my dog (a seven year old SPCA-special, mini Aussie/Border Collie mix), coupled with the need to shave a few pounds from her as an added preventive measure - ultimately, these biscuits, bits and pieces included, have replaced many of the more caloric treats I was giving my dog - that's why I don't mind the broken bit (yes, I was guilty of providing too many treats, hence the need for her to drop a bit of weight).  Although my dog doesn't have joint issues, she has dropped two pounds and if that's all the biscuits do for her at this stage, well, I still think we're both ahead of the game :)Here's hoping my dog doesn't tire of these biscuits :)",My picky eater gobbles these up.,5

I am sure I can be creative enough to figure a way to attach a key but it would be nice if it came with this feature.  I live in a neighborhood where I like to keep my door locked even if I am only going out for a short walk and keeping a house key on the leash makes things much easier because I don't have to worry about remembering or holding onto a loose key.

This was the best thing I came across to use for his little drip issue we were having. I just remodeled and I wanted to be comfortable and I wanted him to be comfortable as well.  Bailey knew he had an issue as he tried constantly to clean up after himself, I started using this and he was so much happier!  Now a few pointers!!The pads are not worth the money!! They are not very absorbent, They do not stick well at all and if they get a tad damp forget it they fall off, they crunch up in the wrap making them useless and more expensive the female products soooooo...I used Poise Ultra Absorbent people pads inside and they were fantastic VS the Simple Solutions pads which sadly were terrible and a total waste of money. Simple Solution pads are just over priced expensive Kotex pads that could not handle the amount of urine that can occur unlike the Poise pads, remember this is what Poise pads are used for. You should get the ones that fit how much you dog drips so it may take some experimenting my dog was large so mine were the most absorbent I could get. Great thing is you can get them in-store and on sale almost anywhere!I bought baby wipes to wipe him down and keep him clean, remember it is the same concept as a baby wearing a diaper and sitting in it, I didn't want to risk any infection. No alcohol!Make sure you measure your dog, to tight can cause a lot of chafing!! Mine was the right size but I ended up sewing micro-fiber cloth on the elastic part where the material scrunched up as this was causing chafing behind his manly area. He was not use to anything rubbing his skin in that area and the material is pretty stiff. I had to leave it off till it healed and sadly I never had the chance to see if the microfiber would have relieved the problem. Make sure you check your dog to make sure this is not occurring due to some dogs have a higher tolerance to pain. It would be great if they could use a softer material in the elastic area. I wish they were a tad cheaper in price, I did purchase one at Petsmart and the other on Ebay for a fraction of the cost, if you don't mind used(they are washed!!) it's a deal!

When you look on the bag at what supplements are included, it has a lot of vitamins listed, among other things.  While I don't think this sort of product is essential for doggy health, if I'm going to toss the dog something for being a good pup, it might as well have vitamins in it as not.Note: the bag warns that you should only give your dog one supplement per day or at most two (one in the AM one in the PM), but that dogs might consider this a treat so you should make sure the bag is secured so they don't steal and eat the whole pack.

Like I said, I buy the big bag of Blue Buffalo in order to save money; rather then buying a bunch of little bags throughtout the month just doesnt make sense. Out of all the shapes and sizes, this one was cheap and had a lid on top -both must's for our family-The shape of this one really makes it hard to fit the kibble and the lid takes up even more room; ridges. Since I have a few lbs of food left over, I try and fit every last piece of kibble in there that I can. So the way the lid twists on is great for keeping the food fresh, but not so great for fitting extra pieces of kibble. The indented handles and the angles on the sides also makes it harder to fit more food. Oh well.I like the 2-cup scooper it comes with; very handy when its time to feed the dog.

4249,Cute Chihuahua,We have a Chihuahua that has been using training pads since she was very young. We have a large litter box that we put the training pads in and she has never had a problem using them. Over the last 13+ years we have purchased many different brands and quality of pads. I would estimate that we have tried 15 different brands in all. We have had some training pads that are basically useless with hardly any filling in them. We have also had training pads that have been way too small or not evenly shaped. On the other hand we have had some nice and thick and absorbent training pads that are plenty big enough as well. The point is that all training pads are not all created equal. Typically you will have to pay about twice or three times as much for the really good training pads.These training pads are large at 23 x 22 inches wide. They aren&#8217;t the absolute thickest training pads that we have ever used but they are still nice and thick one of the top several that we have used when it comes to thickness. They absorb a lot of liquid and I haven&#8217;t had any puddles on top of the pad. It says that a single pad can hold 3 cups of water. I don&#8217;t quite believe that but they are very absorbent. I have never had one that dripped when I picked it up. Keep in mind that we have a Chihuahua so it may be different with a bigger dog. They have a built-in odor neutralizer and an attractant to help train your dog. It&#8217;s supposed to help encourage them to go on the pad. Our dog was already trained so I have no idea if the attractant works. I will say that long ago when we originally trained our dog the attractants didn&#8217;t help at all. These pads are very soft and lay nicely in the box. The last training pads that we had were stiff and didn&#8217;t always lay the way that we wanted it to. When you lay these pads down they conform to the area.Overall I think these are one of the best value training pads that we have used. Out of all the other training pads I would say these are better than most of them and they are priced much more reasonably than some of the other really good training pads. Based on my experience I think these are definitely worth a try.,"Very absorbent, large size and well made. Good value!",5

Our 12 year old girl has considerable issues with her joints, so I wanted to give these a try.The taste test - in the interest of full disclosure, I should mention that the 12 year old will eat anything, so it was no surprise when she tore this from my fingers and swallowed it whole. The 8 year old is more cautious, and he sniffed it thoroughly before carefully extracting it from my grasp. He gobbled it up. The chews definitely passed the taste test.The additive - So this is subjective, since neither of my dogs are gifted with speech, but it seems to me that the 12 year old is moving a little more easily, and making the climb up the stairs a little faster. Either way, it isn't hurting.The only downfall - humans will probably not enjoy the strong aroma when you open the package. While dogs seem to appreciate it, humans ...not so much.",Seems to help with joint issues,4
4272,Me,"""Okay, so I have been google-ing more information about Coralife Colormax bulbs and if they work with planted aquariums but could NOT find any info so decided to purchase one anyway. Well, it works alright, it keeps plants alive and growing (my anacharis plants grow about maybe an inch or two weekly). The color is not as bright as you would expect to see (compared to that of a 6500k bulb), also the leaves on my anacharis plants do look vivid green, however, my plants could look a lot more \""alive\"" or \""happier\"". While I do like the color it gives off, many people do seem to dislike the dimmer color it gives off, however, perhaps if paired with a 6500k CFL, that works just great. I recommend this CLF light bulb for a low light planted aquarium, however, if you are looking for more live looking plants I say just skip this bulb and go for a 6500k CFL instead.""",Works for low light planted aquariums (READ FOR MORE INFO),4

The product is marketed to canine athletes; my dogs get a fair amount of leashed exercise but aren't competing in anything but couch time.I've long thought that the perfect pharmaceutical for me would be a pill that made me love exercise as much as my dogs do.  These doggie vitamins come close, giving my dogs (who eat a medium grade of dogfood) extra energy and life.

My First thought was for her Safety/Comfort. After previously owning a basket for another animal I had in the past- I opted not to go that route again. Let's just say- cheaper isn't better and some baskets are not intended for your little furry friend. This Solvit Wicker Bicycle Basket was not only versatile- but comfortable for your pet- and provide the necessary safety attachments needed to ensure your furry friend stays put.After much research on other sites and price comparing- The Solvit was my #1 Choice for my Stella.Aside from the bike being a bit unstable when the dog is removed and you have left it parked on the kick stand- That's the only unstable part of it. The positive thing is that the basket is EASILY Removed with a quick tip up from the bracketry mounted to the handlebars. This also makes hauling and preserving the basket convenient, quick, and simple.My first ride with Stella was not the best- but I suppose that's to be expected. My husband rollerblading ahead and myself riding the bike with basket attached and Puppy in tow. She was crying for my husband one minute- the next her tongue hanging out long, panting, and enjoying the Florida breeze. I have to say the next go around will be alot more promising.

4354,Patricia E. LaPointe,Our 8 month old Shepherd Mix loves this toy. I have had a hard time finding a toy she chews often that she doesn't destroy in a few days to a week and this is it. She is now on her second one and loves to chew on it all the time. She does well with her Kongs (wubba and extra strength regular kong) but she doesn't like to chew on them the way she does with this. It keeps her satisfied and away from any other inanimate plastic objects in the house. Unlike the lady with the pit our dog has no interest in the middle section of the toy unless you count carrying it in her mouth to show it to you (when she wants to play). She ate it little by little but they were such small pieces that it didn't bother her in any way and I followed the manufacturers instructions to throw it away when the ends were worn. It took her a full month to get it to that level which is the longest lasting toy she's had yet. I recommend this to puppy owners who have a dog that loves to chew.

These two belts are the ones in the lower left illustration in your instructions. The current length of the belts will not allow this. As a matter of fact when I was trying to stretch them down to place them under the corner I heard the stitches on the inside attachment point pop. Now the stitching is coming undone at that point! Now I'm going to have to find some Grey thread and repair/reinforce that stitching to ensure it doesn't come completely undone!Other this this significant fault in the design I think the rest of the hammock is designed very well, attaches securely, and fits very nicelyMy two suggestions for product improvement to the manufacture is:1) I would also suggest that you use better stitching on the neoprene belt mounts, (heavier duty thread and more stitching).2) Each of these neoprene belts should have been at least 4 inches longer, or possibly adjustable if they are going to properly fit around the lower corner of the rear seat as you have shown.","Almost perfect, needs 2 product improvements.",4

I used a knife to cut the bag and poured it into an empty Tidy Cat plastic litter container.3.  Great priceCON:1. The urine sometimes sticks to the bottom of both my cat's cat boxes and is like scrapping off sticky wet cement.  I used Scoop Away,  Tidy Cat and a Wal-Mart boxed brand that acted like Scoopable before and those 3 products did not wetly cling to the bottom of the cat box.  Those litters must absorb the wet quickly and not settle on the bottom and harden.  You cannot just easily scoop out the urine clumps because they have to be seriously scrapped off the bottom of the box which takes time and is gross and never comes completely off.  Also as the scooper scrapes the urine soaked lumps off off bottom of pan, the clumps fall apart spreading their stench amongst the clean litter and the clumps are now too small to scoop out.  Both my cats' litter pans are very very deep and filled high with litter because I have a cat that digs and if the litter is shallow, he leaves his bundles of joy uncovered.  Plus I don't like picking up heavy litter and try to pour as much in the pans as possible and refresh the litter as it goes down.2.  It does not clump as well as Scoop Away, Tidy Cat Mutliple Cat or that Kitty WalMart boxed brand.  The urine clumps sometimes break up.3.  It does not contain smells.  I have 2lb bucket with twist off lid I put the cat litter in.  This Precious Cat Litter reeks after a day or 2 when I untwisted the lid to add more clumps to it.  My bucket has a tight sealed top so the smells don't escape until I open the lid so this is not a problem.Wal-Mart Miss Kitty (or whatever the Kitty name on their litter is) is cheaper and better but if you don't like to drive and face the crowds at Wal-mart because they won't ship their Kitty litter...then this is a good 2nd choice.",I Would Buy Again,4

I usually put a lot of treats in it so they come out a little more frequently, I dont want my dog to get too frustrated with it. With the amount of treats I put it in it (I use broken up mini-milk bones he seems fine with it), enough of a payout for the work and it keeps him occupied for 10-15 minutes at a time.The downside to this toy (why I knocked off a star) is that it originally had a VERY strong plastic smell. So strong that my dog wouldn't use it. Maybe 3 weeks/month after I put it out for him he has really started using it which is good, but it took that long for the smell to wear off enough for him to use it.

4380,Tom V Worcester MA,"UPDATED ON 3-22-14:  I increased my rating from 3 to 4 stars.Well, they work but they ride down her butt so fast that I had to tape them on her with gentle release masking tape so as not to pull her hair out.  In the meantime, I ordered the Extra Large size.  The XL fits her perfectly.  They cover further up her back and cover a much larger area.  They ride down too but not as fast.  Nevertheless, I had to tape those on as well.  My home made pads work beautifully.  (mentioned below)Check out my two pictures.  Customers' pics are placed low on the page on the right side, now, at least on this product.UPDATED ON 3-2-14:  Bella is in season and the PeePee pads work great!  I cut the pads into 8 inch by 5 inch rectangles and stuck one on with double-sided tape.  Worked beautifully!  And cheap too.As mentioned below, the size I bought was too small so I purchased 4 feet of two-sided (non-sticky) Velcro 3/4 inch wide.  I cut two pieces about 7 inches each.  This tape has loops on one side and hooks on the other.  Just attached to the tabs on the diaper that already have Velcro and brought the added strips around to meet the other tabs.  Fits great and can be easily adjusted.  I thought I was going to have to sew on the Velcro but my wife pointed out that it was not necessary.  Brilliant!After a while of walking around, the diaper does slide down her bum some so I have to pull it back up and make sure her tail is all the way through.  This is much better than having to follow her around with Windex wiping up blood spots on the floor.  See pictures above.  (End of Update)I carefully measured my dog's girth in front of her hind legs (her waist).  It is between 20 and 21 inches so I bought the Medium size which states it fits up to 23 inches because I know these type of garments tend to slip off from reading others' reviews.  Well, they DO NOT FIT.  I paid too much for shipping to return these so I'll have to keep them and add some Velcro so that they don't cut off her circulation.On another point, these otherwise well-made diapers are too short in that they only snug up to cover her bum and I know they will  not stay on for long.  They should have a rubber strip contacting the fur to help hold them on.Another reviewer mentioned they should have suspenders to go around the front of the dog and perhaps around the neck to keep them from sliding off and I agree.  I will probably break out the sewing machine and do just that.  They will look ridiculous but she won't be wearing them outdoors anyway.  And who hasn't had a good laugh at their dog's expense at one time or another? :-)  I once tried to make my own diaper for her and it was hysterical!  Took lots of pictures.  :-DThe diapers are well made with an (unnecessary) breathable liner exactly like you would find inside a man's bathing suit.  They will NOT absorb anything on their own.  They must have a disposable liner/pad attached.  The tail hole stretches well and should fit a large dog's tail although I might worry it may be too tight.  How do you check to see if your dog's tail is turning blue?  Ha ha.  Any way...My tip of the day:  Don't waste money buying the liners made for this diaper.  I buy the puppy training pads for the floor.  They are very absorbent and much, much cheaper than the pads.  I cut a piece just right to fit my dog and stick it to the diaper with double-sided tape (or roll a wide piece of packing tape).

4385,Sneaky Burrito,"This particular variety of Fancy Feast doesn't seem to be available at my local store (at least, not in large quantities), but I was interested in getting a lot of it after reading about it elsewhere online.  First of all, the Classic Tender Beef Feast variety of Fancy Feast doesn't have any gluten or grain ingredients (cats are obligate carnivores and don't naturally eat grains).  Plus, one of my cats (who needs to put on some weight) strongly prefers beef over other protein sources.The ingredients are: beef, meat broth, liver, fish, meat by-products, artificial and natural flavors, guar gum, potassium chloride, calcium phosphate, salt, magnesium sulfate, taurine, zinc sulfate, thiamine mononitrate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate, niacin, sodium nitrite (to promote color retention), manganese sulfate, calcium pantothenate, Vitamin A supplement, copper sulfate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, biotin, folic acid, Vitamin D-3 supplement, potassium iodide.While this would not be ideal for a cat with inflammatory bowel disease (vets recommend that IBD cats avoid beef, fish, and sometimes also guar gum), if you have an IBD cat who won't eat anything else, you might want to give this a try.  I am not currently feeding this to my IBD cat, but am glad to always have some around in case I should happen to need it for him.The cat who IS eating this absolutely loves it.  It's gone almost as soon as it hits the bowl.  I have been feeding her half a can per day as a supplement to her normal diet.  The texture is soft and there are no large pieces, so even cats with tooth problems should be able to handle it.  The smell is not too strong, either.  The only real drawback is that it is a bit hard to find lids to cover the cans as these are a smaller size (3 oz.) and most lids are made for 5.5 oz. cans.Anyway, if you have multiple cats and have at least half a dozen kinds of cat food around at any given time (like I do), this is a great one to add to the list.",fancy feast classic beef feast,5

4388,Shady,"I purchased this for my newly rescued Lab mix and I like everything about this martingale collar. It is lightweight, pliable and hangs comfortably loose around my dog's neck until she puts tension on her lead. Then the collar cinches securely around her neck, depending on the applied tension. yet it never tightens to the point that it chokes as long as it has been adjusted properly upon the initial fitting. I can easily slip the collar off over her head when I need to without having to unlatch it. The 'quick snap' latch, though, is a reassuring feature that will allow for quick release in the event that my dog ever gets her collar snagged on something. I doubt that I'll ever have to use that feature, but better safe than sorry when it comes to my dog. I recommend this collar to anyone looking for the martingale style.",Nice!,5

4399,A. Boston,"UPDATE May '12: Previously this was a 4 star review, I just had to knock it down to 3 because of the construction and durability. While carrying this up and down the stairs, part of the handle snapped from the body. I was using the handle made to carry this(further down from the handle used to push and maneuver), so I was shocked when I heard the cracking noise. It still works, but the top is loosely dangling unless pushed down and handled gently. Now I've gorilla taped it, though that just doesn't fix the issue of quality -- this should be meant to carry from floor to floor. I loved this vac and am really disappointed in the cheap plastic construction.Original review:I'm a known vacuum junkie, this is one of three currently in rotation! My favorite is theLG Kompressor Drive Pet Care Vacuum  LuV350P, but this one is holding it's own. I have 2 cats and a dog with hardwood floors throughout. With these 3 and my cat allergies, I tend to vacuum at least 3 times a week. I like to take a quick spin around, and always use the tools to get in the tight spots and under furniture. Here are a few things I don't love...Cons:1. The wand tool is very short, so I'm stooping over a lot, even if I'm just doing a corner. I would love it to be longer so I can stand upright while getting the areas the vacuum doesn't fit.2. The wheels are huge, so they end up picking up stuff that sticks to them and forget about going underneath anything!3. It's very heavy, so I won't be using this one on the stairs. On top of that, I like a good handle on the body of the machine and this one was awkward to use. So that combined with the weight means it's staying on one floor of the house. I carry the LG all over the place, up and down stairs, so that will still be my go-to vacuum cleaner.Pros:1. I liked that it was so easy to empty the bin, you just flip a switch and slide it out.2. The on-board spot remover isn't that helpful for me since I don't have carpet, but I can see using it often if it did.3. Has great suction and nice, long cord4. I love the button placement on the top, easy to reach without searching for it. There's an on/off button and also a floor/carpet button. I have a few small area rugs, so I do use the floor/carpet button more than I would have expected.5. Has different height levels so I can choose to keep it at the lowest for doing the floors or raise it so I'm not just tugging area rugs around because the suction is too tight. It glides over much easier when you have that option.",Great Vac until.....,2

Although it's intended to be used in conjunction with the regular formula, I decided to try it alone on a couple of mild stains (fresh ones).  Then I loaded the machine with plain water and walked away.  When I came back, the stains were completely gone - and at a fraction of the cost of using the in-machine formula.  I also like that using plain water to clean up the pre-treatment means I don't have to worry about any cleaning residue on the carpet.A third stain a few days later did require a double treatment, but it was still easier and cheaper than the old way.

4417,"""A. Dent \""Aragorn\""""","There are 2 main components of this system: the transmitter and the dog collar. The transmitter emits a radio signal that's picked up by a receiver in the collar. Whenever your pet goes too far, the collar device first produces some warning sounds, then administers the dog an electric shock. The intensity can be controlled, on a scale of 1 to 6. You also get a bunch of flags that are supposed to be visual clues for the dog during training.I titled this review 'reliable' because we've had one of these transmitters for about 4-5 years and, after we plugged the transmitter in and set the range to the 'max', never had to revisit it. As for collars, we started with one, for one dog. We had to replace it after a couple of years because it stopped working. Since then, we bought 1 more because we have 2 dogs now.To make it short, on our 2 puppies, we had no need to study the manual, plant little flags or any other training clues. Our training lasted about 30 minutes. As soon as they got zapped a couple of times and learned to associate the warning tone with 'run toward the house', they were fully trained. End of story.My issue problem with this system is the range. Yes, I know, that I can buy 2 transmitters and therefore extend the range a bit but, at these prices, I can't afford to do this. All I wanted was to be able to extend the range from the current about 70-80 feet all around to maybe a 120 feet radius around the transmitter. Somehow, I think this should be quite possible.Oh, the new collars require the somewhat expensive but a lot easier to install PetSafe batteries. Buy them from Amazon if Amazon proper is selling them (no shipping charges on $25 orders) and you will be paying about half anyone else is charging - remember, everyone else is going to add shipping charges and maybe sell taxes.","Reliable, range could be better",4

When we'd take it off after a walk, she'd grab it and toss it around like the chew toy she turns to when she's angry.I think this would work for most smaller dogs, but if your dog doesn't like it, you will have very stressful walk sessions until you switch back to what he/she likes.

I've never been able to get one to fit properly - when snug the straps dig into the dog's armpits.  I\""ve tried both M and L harnesses and can't seem to find the right fit without causing the dog discomfort.  The martingale loop in the front is essential to how it functions, but it also causes some extra slack which in turn causes some swinging from the leash hardware- it's unfortunately less annoying to keep the leash taught during the walk to keep it from swinging.. not what I want to teach the dog.  Overall I just find it too annoying and my harness search continues.""",Cant get a proper fit,3

(I didn't want to waste the money on a medium only to have him grow out of it again.)One of my only concerns with this is that the leash could be longer. If it were, I'd be able to tie it to a door handle and let my cat hang out on my deck without having to hold the leash in my hand the whole time.If you have a small kitten I'd recommend getting him or her used to the harness as soon as possible. Mine doesn't really fight the harness anymore because we've been using them since he was so little.We will be going on a road trip this winter, he and I, and this leash will be invaluable to avoid having him run away from me in South Carolina or someplace.

It worked out real well. What I fed her was her pate cat food mixed with enough chicken broth to make a soupy, almost baby food type meal. I gave her the Vibactra 3 times a day since she was quite weak. How I measured her dose was to fill the dropper full and then squeeze out the required dose which was 5 drops for her into a small plastic cup and then put the remaining drops that were in the dropper back into the bottle, then get the drops in the plastic cup back in the dropper and gave that to the kitty.

Not having a very easy to go off of guideline for sizing and using a similar product for sizing (an REI Ruffwear dog pack) was a size small and it was huge on him so I figured that a small in this product would be ok. As far as sizing I feel that the sizes are way too small for the actual size. The size small would fit like a weiner dog or something but I should have got a medium. The issue is in the chest. The rest of the pack is fine but the chest is WAY too small. It barely extends enough and then its on it does not sit on his chest its up in his throat. The pack itself is great and very useful but it just doesnt fit well in the front. The rest of it size wise is great I just wish the front expanded more. I hate doing online returns so I may just end up finding someone to give it to and getting something else I don't know. But the idea is great. Just know that a 20LB mini aussie does not fit in a small. If you are unsure get a size bigger. It can be sinched down.,"Great idea, but runs small",3

4454,GraySkiesR,"My super energetic cat love, love, loves this toy. I had to keep it in the closet to stop him from getting at it. And the feathers had to be hidden too since he thinks they are a chew toy when they aren't flying through the air.And my lazy, barely plays with anything at all, older cat actually runs after this and sometimes even jumps!But as you can tell from all the other reviews, this is no surprise. So I will move onto the meat of the review.The feathers I got did pop out of the rubber/plastic attachment after a couple play sessions. I stuck them back in but they would still come out. So I used a little bit of glue and the problem is solved. The rod, string, and swivel hook are all very high quality and though show some minor signs of wear and tear, Da Bird is holding up very well.But one of the other reasons I love this toy is that the toy on the end of the line is interchangeable. There are toys you can buy here on amazon. Feathers, sparkly tassels, furry things and more. But since it is interchangeable you can make your own parts too.When my cats seemed to get tired of the feathers, I crumpled up a ball of paper and put that on. The loud noise of the paper was a surefire hit. I also used a safety pin and a catnip mouse to make a fun &#34;Da Mouse&#34; toy. But what surprised me the most was when I had taken off the toy and was working on making a new one while still holding it. My cat started playing and going after the hook on the end. He really liked it, but couldn't seem to see it all the time. So I hooked on a paper clip. And it was his favorite thing for a whole week.So GoCat has really perfected the wand and line part of a wand cat toy. The wand and line are slim enough that they blend into the background and the cat focuses on the toy on the end. And even though it's slim, it is also very, very durable and has withstood chewing, bending, hitting surfaces and being dragged around.","Amazing Cat Toy, multiple options means more fun",5

Things were coming along nicely until I noticed one of my algae-feeding  Bamboo (Fan) shrimp had stopped eating. So was this his dislike of the green algae, or what? I had noticed that both Bamboo shrimp did not like it when I ran the UV machine a lot, so could have been that.BUT- a week went by and he's still not &#34;fanning&#34;. Ruh-roah Roarge.Stopped the water changes, turned off the UV machine, made no difference. One of the shrimp is eating, the other is just in the cave, sitting there, day after day.Just for the heck of it I did a test for ammonia, and to my shock, it was about .75 to 1 PPM, which is WAY too high; it has always tested at &#34;0&#34; once the tank got established. I had evidently diminished the nitrifying bacteria and the ammonia was making the shrimp ill.Out came the Purigen, placed 125ml into Seachem's &#34;The Bag&#34;, a quick rinse, and into the Cascade 700 GPH filter it went. Within the hour the non-eating Bamboo shrimp was out and &#34;fanning&#34; like he should be.The next day my ammonia level had dropped to .25 PPM.If you don't have any toxic problems now it might not be a bad idea to have some of this on hand.

4459,"""Fiona Cat \""Fiona Cat\""""","I had read in a book by a veterinarian who specializes in cats that cats prefer an open litter pan. I was using huge covered pans which he pointed out are preferred by owners, not cats, as they confine smells and litter better. I had 4 younger cats and an elderly cat who could not longer climb into the box so I had used dog training pads for her in her last days. One of the younger cats got the idea this was a neat idea so I found myself retraining him to the litter box after her death. I decided too to buy some new open pans and clean, then air out the old pans for a time figuring I could alternate pans as the covered ones would be okay without the lids if they are freshened. Some one in the Pet section mentioned he put his litter box on one of the Petco 700 series Dog crate replacement trays so I bought this large litter pan and a tray. Having this set up helped immensely with retraining the cat to think inside the box so I bought a second set plus one extra tray for their food and water dishes. The tray allows me to set the box aside and pour back into it any litter that gets clawed outside the box. Main caution with this box is to not put in too deep a layer of litter to try to maintain litter inside the box when the cat buries his achievement.","Sturdy, high sides, practical",5

4470,Neutralist,"""I have a number of freshwater planted 10 gallon tanks.  I own both the Marineland Single Bright and the Double Bright models.  While the double bright is in fact double the brightness, they are narrowly concentrated and the plant growth is affected by the placement of the plants directly below the LEDs.  This is also a huge problem if you have any floating plants blocking certain LEDs from reaching the light below.While a bit less bright, the Single Bright evenly covers the tank with behavior similar to a single T8 light.  The plant growth for low light plants such as Java Moss and Java Fern can be kept without worrying about algae problems, especially if you \""tape to block\"" the blue LEDs since there is not a separate switch to turn just the blue LEDs off.  Because of the number of LEDs present, the floating plants or placement of the plants are much more forgiving than the Double Bright model.While the light works fine on black substrate, my recommendation is to go with natural or \""whiter\"" substrate to allow the light reflections to help spread the coverage.Lastly, the power adapter is detachable at the cord that plugs in right next to the on/off switch.  This is very convenient since the light can be quickly unplugged and moved out of the way.  The Double Bright has the cord permanently attached, so moving the light is not as easy.Strongly recommended for anyone looking to lower the cost of electricity.I have tested the following plants in a 10 gallon tank:Ludwgia Repens X: This plant turns green to red to indicate light intensity.  Under a single T8 6500k bulb, the plants' bottom is usually green while top half of the leaves turn bronze to red.  Under this LED light, the red turned to green and maintained slow growth.  Therefore, I know that this light provides lower \""PAR\"" and spectrum not as ideal as a single T8 bulb.Amazon Sword: Don't bother under this light.  Mine melted.Java Fern: Stayed the same size with little to no new growth.Java Moss: Continued to grow.  Perfect for the low LED light.Dwarf Sag: Don't bother.Hornwort: Floating hornwort melted slowly melted away.Pennywort: Leaves continued to grow, but looked very soft bright green.Duckweed: Well, they are duckweed.  They grew.So, there you have it.  Should give you a good reason to stay with T8 bulbs or take chances with this LED light.

4490,Tom,"We bought two of these based on good reviews.  We have a couple of cats that live in the garage and it gets down to 60ish out there at night. We also have a big fat old male cat that lives indoors.The two girls out in the garage took to it immediately and even sleep together on it, which says a lot because they dont really like each other!The male cat was a little concerned about it at first due to the crinkling sound.  But I put it on the table next to the window where he likes to sleep and then noticed about 3/4 through the day that I hadnt seen him.  Right on the pad.  He usually comes down and watches tv with me at night and sleeps on my head, but he decided to stay on his pad most of the time and sleeps there now.Which is a major plus, since having a 20-something pound cat sleeping on your head isnt the greatest thing in the world.I've washed them in our front loader on delicate/handwash and they came out clean but the fabric holds plenty of fur.  Hung them out to dry per the instructions, which didnt take long.These are nice for reflected heat without electricity.  Perfect for indoors and milder climates.  While it'd be better than nothing for outdoor/feral cats during northern winter weather, I think you really need something that plugs in for those applications.We have a pair of the 6 watt pet bed heaters on a big, thin cardboard box with a thick towel over them and the thermal mat on top of the towel in between the heated pet bed pads.  The girls switch between the electrically heated pads and the thermal bed.  Total of 12 watts to keep them warm and comfortable is a pretty low price to pay.We'd been using a heating pad on low, but the thermal pet bed heaters use less electricity and have much thicker plastic covers so claws have a harder time penetrating.",Cant get the cat off of it,5

The air stone is small but effective.  I bought this for an emergency backup for my &#34;50&#34; gallon tank not for regular use so I only ran it a few minutes. All air pumps are noisy and this is no different.

4493,Chicago Book Addict,"I have a 4-year-old Cockapoo who in the past 3 years has developed a bit of a barking problem.  I've tried everything I could to stop it short of more work with a trainer.  I was curious about a device that would help stop barking but didn't want anything that would hurt my pet, so this product seemed like a good solution.  I liked that it wouldn't hurt my pet and that it could be set up in automatic mode so it would respond to him whenever he barked without my manually having to use the device.At first, it seemed to work reasonably well.  I watched the device and it did a good job of picking up on when my dog barked, even when he was straight across the room.  I also noticed his ears perking up when the device went off.  It usually wouldn't stop him from barking completely, but it would distract him long enough that I could sometimes interrupt him and get him to do something else.  Over time though I do feel like he's gotten used to it and thus, it seems to become less and less effective.  It's possible that it has affected the barking slightly but not enough, unfortunately that it is noticeable.","Seems to be doing SOMETHING, but doesn't quite solve the barking problem",2

4495,Autumn,"""Edit: When I ordered this it was under 50 bucks, just so you know.April 2014 update after original review.Above all else, the best thing about this cat tree is that the cat LOVES it. Before I even put it together my little \""mouse\"" (as I call her, because she is a tiny thing) was already playing with the ball on the string. It's on a stretchy cord and it rattles, making it a great source of entertainment. Since it's been put together, she's been steadily going at it for 15 minutes.I would take product pics but she's being too rambunctious! When she mellows out I will, if I remember.As far as the construction.. it wasn't SUPER hard but it wasn't particularly easy. Definitely not labor-intensive but the directions aren't that great and the parts aren't labeled (at least, they weren't for me). So it's kind of like guess and check. As far as stability, it does appear to be pretty secure though when my silly kitten leaps onto it from across the room it gets a BIT wobbly. But I think that's more her approach than the product itself. She's a hyperactive 4 month old kitten and enjoys bouncing around all over the place on it. If you have an older, more mellow cat I would have no worries, but if you have a little kitty or a particularly active kitty, I'd just keep an eye on it.One of the main reasons I got this is because we recently moved and the windows in this new house are mostly sill-less and high up, meaning my poor indoor kitty can't even LOOK outside. I would catch her trying to climb shelves and bookcases all of the time trying to get a glance out the window and it genuinely depressed me. But now that problem has been resolved and she can see the trees move and the snow fall and lay in the sun again :)So, as an immediate first impression this is excellent. I will update if there are any problems!Update: a new problem. This thing SHEDS fuzzies ALL over the place. I'm constantly sweeping them up off the floor and pulling them off of little whiskers and tails. Definitely an annoyance but doesn't change the function of it any.April 2014 update: I made this review from 4 stars to 3, and I'm debating making it 2. As others have said, this thing falls apart over time. It wobbleas like crazy now and it seems like no matter how much I twist and tighten, the parts are loose. The rattley-ball part broke off, it sheds like crazy, and it's nowhere near as nice as it was at first. For a cheap short-term option, this might be good, but definitely not for the long term. The cat still dares to use it despite its wobbliness, but it definitely makes me nervous!""",Kitten's new favorite thing!,3

She took it in her mouth, but that was about it. No interest at all in the eggs.  I even followed the directions that are attached to the toy. It does appear to be well-made, and I like the fact that it is washable. The exception is the squeakers--two of the squeakers in the eggs did not work right out of the box, so that was a disappointment, especially since my dog loves to squeak her toys. Five eggs arrive with the toy (that's two extras), but one would hope that all of the squeakers would work.UPDATE:  after a few weeks, Meg has warmed up to this toy. She's still not quite sure what to do with the eggs once she has them out of the toy, but seems to like the furry texture. I'm upgrading my evaluation to four stars.  Still not happy that the squeakers in the eggs didn't squeak, but I will say that the main part of the toy has held up well, especially given that my dog must take a stuffed animal with her every time she goes outside, so this one has made the trip outside dozens of times now.""",pretty good toy after all...,4

This can be solved by using a circulation pump such at the VicTsing 80 GPH submersible available from amazon.com.I would not recommend this as a primary filter on anything larger then a 10 gallon tank but it is useful as a secondary filter or a primary filter for a 10 gallon isolation/medicine tank. Recently I attached this to an Aquatop submersible UV-5 unit with a short length of garden hose. it works great for this, and the Low GPH makes it effective at level 1 sterilization (killing algae. bacteria  and viruses in the water column for up to a 50 gallon tank).I do not believe in using zeolite (amon chips) and always toss them out. The problem with them is that they will release the ammonia they have absorbed if salt is added to the water. This is very bad as the first step after doing a water change when an ammonia spike occurs is to add salt to the water along with something like seachem prime, If you do not remove the zeolite before doing this then the problem will be compounded.I also do not use carbon on a regular bases. It is great for taking medicine out of the water, but beyond that it is not good for much.. First it is only effective for 2 weeks or so. Second it not only takes out some of the bad stuff it also takes out a lot of the good trace elements needed by fish and plants.

4553,"""E. Gamez \""Cheddar323\""""","""Well I actually had to  go through quite some trouble to get this filter delivered to me but it finally came. The setup was quite simple and I followed the instructions. Everything was assembled fairly quickly and easy but for some reason my package didn't come with a level. So far I'm pleased with the power of the filtration and the overall look. For the first few hours this filter was very quite and I couldn't even tell it was running. I went to the grocery store to buy some stuff and when I came back I noticed it was making more noise then before. I searched on YouTube to see if anybody else is having the same issue and it seems people are. A lot of people say it's the propeller in the motor that causes a rattling noise. I'm not one to complain about the noise because I've had louder filters before but I expected this one to be as nice and quite as when I first installed it. I'm not going to lie though after a while or at least at night when I'm trying to go the bed seeing as my tank is in the same room I sleep in the noise gets a bit annoying. I'm seeing on YouTube that the only fix is to take off the motor and lubricate the propeller. I'm going to have to remove the motor eventually to clean it out but I just find it a bit tedious to have to grease the impeller every now and then so it doesn't make that damn noise. I've read some people say that after a while the filter will settle down and break in and stop making so much noise I really hope that's the case. If not then I might have to keep this filter for as long as I can and then look to replace it with something else. It sucks that I had to go through so much trouble to get this filter hoping that it would be the perfect product but sadly it felt short. I will make an update if things get better but if not then this will be my final word. The product looks good and is assembled with ease and runs at a decent price but it has a noise issue well at least for me. I wouldn't say steer away from this filter but just know that you might encounter the same problem. I really had high hopes for this filter so maybe its my fault for expecting it to be flawless but for now I just have to deal with it until I find a solution.**Update**I used the Vaseline trick and it seemed to make a major difference the rattling noise isn't as loud anymore. It's not to say that the noise is completely gone because it's not but I can say it's been minimized to a nice hum. I don't know how long this fix will last I'm pretty sure it's only temporary and I will probably need to lubricate the impeller shaft eventually. For those of you who are having the same issue just type \""Aquaclear 20 noise\"" in the YouTube search bar and you will find a few videos showing you how to do it. So good luck to all of you who decide to purchase this filter and for those who have the rattling noise note that there is a fix for it so don't give up.""",Rattling noise but there's a fix,4

I played with her a bit inside the tent (I am 5' tall, I fit in sitting down with room to spare), then on the next warm sunny day we took the tent out to our deck.Our cat seemed pretty weirded out initially, since we usually take her out on a harness and leash, so she meowed quite a bit and did the head-butt all around the tent. But I tossed her favorite cardboard box and toys in with her, and gave her some space (definitely still keeping one eye on her). Eventually she sprawled on her belly, watching the birds and bunnies on the backyard. I guess she isn't crazy enough to tear it to pieces (she puts her paws up the tent walls to stretch, but hasn't torn it apart so I guess she's being gentle).Cat likes it, we like it especially when we feel too lazy to \""walk\"" her around the yard, so it was actually a great buy.

They eat this stuff up ravenously, just as they've done with other Chef Michael options.

That's not a good combination for your pet, obviously.I do like having this one around, however, as a special and reasonably priced treat for the dogs.

4579,Sam I Am,"First, let me state up front my family's three indoor cats really like the Drinkwell Platinum.  Here are the reasons I rate this product only a four out of a possible five stars:The fact that the Drinkwell needs to be plugged into the wall make it less than ideal. It works in our house but what about people whose cats are indoor/outdoor? Ideally, I would put this Drinkwell out on the back patio, but you can't, because it needs to be safely plugged into an electrical outlet. Is there some reason why this product wasn't designed with the capability to operate completely on battery power?The extremely thin power cord is unacceptable for any home with a curious kitten or any kind of a dog at all.  One crunch and the product would be useless, because the power supply would be completely wrecked.My third concern is the flimsiness of the water flow control switch. This should have been made out of metal or at least a sturdier plastic. The flimsy plastic doesn't look as if it would hold up under any kind of real handling.The positives:My cats really like the Drinkwell.  There's some kind of an instinctive wild-animal behavior which this product brings out in them - they think they're bad-a--mountain lions sucking down water from a mountain stream. I swear to it - they strut over to the Drinkwell like they're a bunch of cougars. Something about the waterfall is particularly appealing, at least to my cats.I may need to buy a second Drinkwell, because one of the moutain lions has taken to guarding the first Drinkwell, protecting it from the other two mountain lions (aka fat lazy housecats).The final positive is the fact that I no longer have to worry about the waterbowl being tipped over or emptied out by playful cats. If you have more than one cat, I definitely recommend spending the extra money to buy the slightly larger Drinkwell Platinum.Another observation: it took my three cats an entire week to decide they wanted to use the Drinkwell. I expected an instant paws up/paws down review, but of course, these are three housecats, not Einstein's little brothers.  Now they all drink from the Drinkwell and play with the waterfall, which is absolutely hilarious to watch.So if you don't have a problem with a cat who chomps on cords and you also have a place where the Drinkwell can safely be plugged into an indoor wall socket, I definitely recommend this product.Update after approximately 6 weeks of use:  Still THRILLED!  The cats love the Drinkwell, and I've got three of the most demanding, hard-to-please cats who hate everything. I'm glad I made this purchase.  Happy cats.

4601,Beatrice Allec,"I have bought two of these 55/75 filters for my 65 gallon tank and while they work great I did have to do some tinkering in order to make them fantastic. Like another reviewer mentioned, this filter's greatest weakness is that every time you replace the filter, you also remove at least 50% of the good bacteria, running the risk of having to cycle your tank all over again--which can be deadly if you have fragile fish.Another issue is that it pulls water through it so quickly that it's likely to stress out fish that prefer slower water currents. Fish such as angelfish and bettas. Fry are also more likely to suffer a short and untimely death from getting sucked into the filter.The filter itself also isn't completely quiet, but not really noticeable unless there is nothing else in the room making much noise. The water splashing back into the tank is noisier, but for me at least that is a pleasant sound.The cost of filter cartridges is also something to take into consideration as well. Ideally the cartridges should be changed about once a month, with the 55/75 version using two at a time. Which means you're probably going to be spending $35 dollars every 6 months if you buy the 12-pack of cartridges for one filter.That's the bad news, onto the good news:There is just enough space in the filter that you can put in something along the lines of bio balls or a folded up piece of plastic mesh (like the kind you'd use to anchor aquatic plants such as Java moss), which will help with the bacterial problem. To help with making the water current friendlier for fragile fish, a Pre-Filter Sponge from Fluval Edge slipped over the end of the intake will work. To lower the cost of cartridge replacement, there is Marineland PA0100 Filter Pad that just needs to be cut into a suitable size; for around $5 you get about 5 months worth of filtration.",The best Hang-On-Back filter I've come across so far,4

As I opened the box and took the toy off the cardboard backing, I accidentally squeaked it.  Jaegar appeared instantly from another room and knew this was for him.  He would not settle down as I found out that there were at least three different squeaks in the toy.  Once I gave the monkey to my boy he took it and ran to the bed where he went crazy squeaking and chewing.As far as construction, not sure if it will hold up, but he did not destroy it after the first hour.  Although it feels like a toilet paper roll sewn into some tough material, it has held up to a mini Dachshund who is a real chewer! Jager does not destroy things just to destroy them, but he loves to chew.  He chews cow hoofs, elk antlers, greenies, etc.  The usual stuffed toy never lasts at all, but this seems better.  I will update if/when he destroys it.  BUT he has already gotten a lot of fun out of it!!!!!The video shows how much he loves this toy.  And no, he does not give it up willingly.  After two hours of continuous chewing and squeaking, he is exhausted and needed a break.  So is Jaegar, who curled up next to me as I wrote this review and uploaded the video and pix.

I wanted to see if clumping litter would have an advantage so I picked up Fresh Step \""extreme\"" odor control clumping litter. I have a single 5 month old kitten so I figured extreme odor control would be more than adequate.First, this litter is incredibly dusty. I use a hooded litter pan and my cat comes out covered in dust, and with the dust comes an odd perfume smell that is added to this litter. There is no way around it, your cat will be covered in dust and smell exactly like this product. I actually enjoy the scent of the non clumping Fresh Step so it's disappointing that this scent is so off putting. Someone else here described it as bad mens cologne, I wouldn't say that's too far off. Also after 2-3 days of the new litter my kitten started having a runny nose and teary eyes, both of which cleared up when I switched back.Second, being this is my first foray into clumping litter I'm not sure if I can blame this on the cat or the litter, but no matter how hard I tried there would still be micro clumps all around the box after scooping.Third, it did a poor job at odor control. We're in the process of figuring out what is giving our kitten diarrhea so a litter with strong odor control is crucial. It would stink for about 2 hours after he poops, and not just near the litter box but the entire room the box is in. For extreme odor control it does a pretty poor job. We don't have an issue with odor with the non clumping, oddly enough.All in all I can't recommend it, there has to be a better clumping litter out there.

Now, which do you think sheds the most hair? You're right, the short hair. Go figure. I can't believe the hair he leaves around on things. The long hair sheds too and gives out some really large hairballs. Well, cats will be cats. We originally had a brush that really cleaned them up and it was quite expensive. It was advertised on TV and I think it was called a Furminator. It was only sold in select stores, to keep the price up I imagined. Well, we misplaced that very useful device. Then I recently noticed this Ultimate Touch Gentle Slicker for Cats hanging on a rack in a grocery  store near the pet foods and supplies.It's a small wire brush that really gets the loose hair out. Fortunately, both of the cats really love it. I brush and brush and take off handfulls of loose fluffy hair. They purr and walk around and make no significant effort to get away. They seem to understand that it's a help to them, as well to us. The big broad surfaces of the cat are real easy to brush. More difficult are the legs and feet, tail and around the head. Oh well, I do my best. Nothing works perfectly and this thing gets rid of a lot of loose hair rather than getting it distributed all over the furniture, drapes and carpet.

4639,"""T. S. Ferguson \""Phillyfergs\""""","""The WalkieWay Safety Collar (in Small) is a collar with a retractable leash built-in.  The idea of the product is that your dog will wear this collar and you will always have a leash built in, just in case you go off-lead and Fido decides to bolt.  You are supposed to reach down and grab the collar, at which time, a thin, strong leash will unreel from the holder.  It has about a two-finger wide handle attached to a thin lead.Here is the major problem with this product (and I tried it on both my dog and gave it to my sister-in-law to try on her dog--really wanted to like this product!): When your small dog has this collar on, the leash part is heavy and bulky.  Because it is the heaviest part of the collar, it naturally ends up under the dog's neck. Both dogs were very irritated by the leash holder, as it bonked against their chest as they tried to walk (my sister-in-law's dog tried to chew it off).  When trying to quickly grab the leash, it was almost impossible to grab because the leash was underneath the dog.  I ended up grabbing the collar, flipping it around and then accessing the leash.  In the case of a quick grab, this product did not help at all.  Also, the leash is not that long.  Imagine a small dog, only about 6-8\"" max. above ground.  Once I had a hold of the leash, the total length was barely enough so that the dog could walk (and I am a short person).In summary, I would not recommend this product for a small dog.  Perhaps the larger models work better, both due to the size of the animal/leash holder ratio and the height from the neck to the hand of the owner for leash length.  But for a small dog, no way!""",Not a product for small dogs...at all!,1

It is a little retractable leash that hangs on the dog's neck and supposedly appears when you need it.

The leash mechanism works well, but is very small and short.  I put it on our dog and he wore it around for a few days while we tried to think of some reason it needed to be there.  It really isn't big enough to replace a real leash and it is too big to sit on his neck without a little annoying to the dog. It just flaps around on his neck and distracts him because he can see it flapping out of the corner of his eye, and he keeps trying to see what it is.  It doesn't hurt him, it just annoys him.  And when he decided to \""herd\"" a car out of our driveway, the retractivle leash did no good because I was on the porch shouting at him, while he was zooming out to the street with that little retractible leash housing flapping in the wind!

It zips off easily for washing.  I've only washed the fleece cover a couple times because I put the entire bed, including fleece cover, inside another cover. (If you want a more stylish cover, the Molly Mutt brand makes covers that nicely fit both the medium and large beds.) One nice feature is that inside the fleece cover, the foam itself is covered in another layer of white fabric. This both protects the foam from invading dog hair and debris, and makes it easier to slip off the fleece cover.These may seem a little pricey, but if your pup's not a bed destroyer these are absolutely worth it.

We broke them up into smaller pieces to make them last a bit longer. If you give them each one spiral at a time, you will go through the pack pretty quickly. They aren't hard enough that the dogs chewed on them for hours (more like a minute--gulp--gone), so with only seven spirals in a pack, they can go pretty fast, especially for the price. Also, with how quickly the dogs ate them, I can't see how they had any dental benefit at all. 3 stars for the fact that the dogs liked them, but the fact that they are packaged so that you will give them one big spiral at a time makes them a bit expensive (~$ 0.90/piece) for the amount of time the dogs actually spend eating them.",Meh...dogs liked them but the human questions their usefulness and value,3

4696,JasK,"Just received this, cost me 29.89usd which is around 38sgd and took me a while to get it up.  Reason being I am in Singapore and the pump supplied with it is 12v, adaptor also 120v while we uses 240v here.  I went to a fish shop to get a  similar Atman pump for 15sgd but due to my negligence, i did not realise that the Atman pump's electrical plug end is a larger 2 pin plug which cannot go through the small hole on the sitting fountain unit. I ended up getting a step-down converter at 15.90sgd for it stepdown from 240v to 120v.Instruction booklet is pretty clear and straight forward. Setting up is easy.  However, the flow of the water isn't too smooth, first effort the water only flow 1/3 from the top down towards the reservior.  I thought my floor isn't flat or perhaps something wasn't even.  I off it again and took out the top and made sure the insides were all laying nicely and flat including the pump and put back the top.  Well now it started flowing from the top but when the water flowed down the bottom part still has some parts which wasnt even and using hands to even it, ended up with wetness on floor despite being careful and tender.  Perhaps the small pump isnt that strong.  I realised evenness is so important for this.  One thing to note, it is so quiet and i cant hear it.My 2 curious kitten was around and about me when i was checking it and setting it up and eventually drank from it.  One straight from the reservoir the other went to the lick the fountain after smelling it for a while.  So far seems so good. Spore is selling this between 78-90sgd and its a nice price for me despite spending extra on the converter and now i have an extra pump with 2 pin which i need to change the head to have a spare pump.  I bought this along with 2 sets of 3x filters which can last me half a year at least i hope.The food tray is cool too.  The blue tubing seems a bit short too.

4704,crys1s,"""UPDATE, 7/17/12: I still like this fountain but my cats have started pawing at the water before they take a drink, and making a huge mess. I now have to place a tray underneath the fountain with 1\"" high sides to contain the \""splashed\"" water and a towel around the tray. Even with the tray, the towel is soaked through within 3 days. Not the product's fault but my cats' idiosyncrasies! Now I change the water more frequently and because the cats are pawing at it, I find litter inside the \""bowl\"" despite the filter being there.Original review, 4 stars, 4/17/12: I purchased this for my 2 cats after I got tired of having to clean and refill thePetmate Fresh Flow Pet Fountain, Medium, Whiteevery other day and most times, everyday! The water in the bowl would get dirty with fur, litter and bits of dry food - my cats love to scratch around the bowl before drinking and dip their paws in it too - and the water pump would get blocked and become noisy. At that point, the cats would meow and give me the look as if to say \""You want me to drink THAT???\"" They win all the time - I would then have to unplug, clean and refill the whole thing. So, I finally decided to get something different. I chose this based on the positive reviews including reviews for the Catit. I bought this larger one because the capacity is double that of the Catit for just under a dollar more at the time of purchase, so they'd have sufficient water for when I have to go out of town for a few days. I've only had it up and running for 4 days and I already love it. It's easy to set up, the water pump is quiet, and it's easy to refill - just pour water directly on it without having to take the whole thing apart! The water is clean all the time as my cats have stopped dipping their paws since the \""bowl\"" is elevated. I no longer have to put out a second bowl to ensure the cats have clean water. A disadvantage is when you have a power outage which occurred today for a few minutes. If the water level is below the blue plastic portion, your pets can't access the water at all. Hence, the 4 stars. It looks like the only way to get around this is to ensure the water level is high enough to at least cover the blue plastic just below the oval convex. I'd suggest putting an extra bowl out if you're going to be away for a day or more. I will definitely do a complete wash and water change every week, and will update this review if any issues crop up.""",Design keeps water clean; pets can't dip their paws in it.,4

4708,"""Flyer16 \""Flyer16\""""","""It is over $200 a pop when I take my 3 large dogs to the groomer so when this went on sale on Amazon I decided to give it a try. I have my dogs shaved down several times in the warmer months so going to the groomers gets costly quickly. This is a very quiet clipper so it didn't bother my dogs at all. It did a good job of clipping them but it does get somewhat bogged down on really heavy coats, which is why I gave it a \""4\"" and not a \""5\"". One of our Rotties has a super heavy coat and it took almost an hour of working through her hair to get it trimmed properly. Not complaining, its a whole lot cheaper than taking them to the groomers, but just be prepared for a little slow going with really thick coats. My dogs have short hair and I used a #3 blade on them and it gave a nice clip that wasn't too short. The blade got hot after about 10 minutes or so of use, but the Andis Coolant did a quick job of cooling it. In retrospect, I suggest that you spend a few extra dollars and get the ceramic blade which stays much cooler. Be sure to oil your blade and let the clipper run for about 10 minutes prior to use to avoid snagging and pulling. The clipper itself is well weighted in your hand and not difficult to use at all. If you are a novice, you might want to find a demo video on line about grooming if you have any questions.

4737,Mobile Alabama Shopper,"""Original review written March 2013:  This collar allows my Doberman to run free off-leash on our unfenced property -- something she needs to do in order to burn off all of her energy. This collar also keeps her from jumping on my little niece and nephew, and stops unnecessary barking. We live between an elementary school and a church where a lot of strangers get together to play baseball, and this collar prevents her from running over there or barking at them.However, these collars are not waterproof as they claim; at least not on the beach or when exposed to saltwater. We took her to the beach and let her off leash -- sand got in the remote and the collar got wet. From then on, the collar would shock her out of the blue, but would do so more when it was raining outside. PetSafe did exchange the collar and remote for another set since I had it less than 8 months (but it was a refurbished, scratched-up set). When we went to the beach with the new collar, I zipped up the remote in a ziploc bag and did not allow my dog to saturate the collar.....I thought if the sand stayed out of the remote and the saltwater did not soak the collar, then all would be well. Nope. Same thing happened to this second set after the beach trip -- she would get shocked out of the blue, and every time when it was drizzling rain. PetSafe could not replace the second defective unit because they discontinued this set over a year ago. I'm now stuck with a collar that I will not use when it's damp outside (which is quite a lot in my area).EDIT 5/30/14: I still have my original box of the collar that PetSafe told me in the Summer of 2012 was discontinued. It is PDT00-11876, what PetSafe is saying on this website is the \""updated version.\"" I don't appreciate being lied to by their customer service. It seems the replacement collar they sent me in 2012 was an old scratched up crap thing and when I complained about it also not functioning properly, they told me it's now discontinued. VERY POOR SERVICE. I'm shopping for a collar for my Siberian Husky and will find another brand.My Doberman sometimes yelps when shocked on 2, and screams on 3. The #1 shock startles her enough -- I believe my unit sends a stronger charge than normal because there is no way I could use the higher setting without causing heart failure. Fortunately, she quickly became collar-smart so that all I have to do is put the collar on her and she'll stop barking without me needing to beep or shock her.The collar does have a beep tone that does not shock -- I always beeped then shocked when first training her, so now all I have to do is beep her without shocking to get her to stop jumping or to come back in her yard.I've shocked my own wrist on setting 2 -- it is just like an electrical shock, like when coming in touch with a live wire or putting a battery on your tongue. It's a strong, startling, vibrating type of feeling; but not a stinging pain.These collars are generally very safe, and allows me to keep a very hyper dog under control. The dog appreciates being able to remain off-leash when on our 4-acre property so she can run at full steam (which she does 4-5 times each day). I feel fewer dogs would end up at the pound if people would learn to use these collars humanely on their pets. They are not useful for housetraining (only consistency, crate-training, and a short leash worn in-house will do that), but they are a savior for dogs who run off, run into the street, chase other animals, bark excessively, or jump on people.""",PetSafe Customer Service Lies,1

In fact, I tasted it myself -- which turned out not to be the best idea since there is virtually no sodium in pet food and poultry and fish don't taste so good mixed together.Nutritionally speaking, this dry food is fantastic; but, if kitty won't eat it, it's a bust.  I have two cats: one will eat almost anything and one is very picky.  Yup, Mr. Picky smelled this food and walked away while the other cat gobbled it up.To be fair, cats are creatures of habit and changing their dry food is significant.  I did get Mr. Picky to eat this over time by mixing it with theIams ProActive Health Mature Adult Premium Cat Nutrition Food, 5.7-PoundI usually buy.The ingredient in this cat food are superior to any other cat food I have seen which they better be considering the price.

4740,Jan,"I am using this product to calm an anxious cat although I believe its mostly recommend for cats that spray. I have an older, very shy cat recently diagnosed with Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Unfortunately, I brought a young cat into my home before she received that diagnosis. Additionally, I knew my older cat was fearful of new people, but because she had previously bonded with my other cat for over 10 years, I thought she would eventually adjust to a new cat. However, given her shyness and probably also due to the fact that she was not feeling well, she was very anxious and upset with the new cat in the house and hid continuously and wouldn't eat (already an outcome of her IBD.) She was also very upset and frightened because we had to give her medications and twice a day for two months, and she hated having the meds squirted down her throat and the whole process was very traumatic for her (and frankly for me as well.) My vet suggested I try feliway. He didn't seem all that hopeful that it would help, but given my desperation to help my anxious cat, he thought it was worth a try. The plug in diffuser is easy peasy to use, just take the top off the liquid recepticle, and twist into diffuser plug, and plug in to outlet. Over the first week or so, one can even see the diffuser working as you can see the vapors coming out of the diffuser. There is no odor detectable to humans, and the cats don't seem to even be curious about the diffuser or go over to smell it. The diffuser lasts about two months of continuous use. BUT DOES IT WORK?  I really don't know. Over time, my cat has gone from a 10 in anxiety and hiding to maybe a 6 or 7, but that could be she is 1) getting a little bit used to having the second cat in the house or 2) after 2 months of steroid meds and antibiotics, her IBD flare has pulled back a bit and she is probably not feeling quite as sick (although she is still not eating much.) So I cannot say a saw a huge difference or any difference that I could assign to the pheromones. But frankly, I am afraid to stop the diffusers (I have one each in each of the two rooms she spends the most time) so for a small price, rather be safe than sorry. By the way, I have also periodically used the spray version, to spray her bed and the places she sleeps and some furniture, as directed on bottle. With the bottle, you can definitely detect an odor right after you spray, its partly the alcohol that is used to propel it, but also, something else not entirely pleasant is detectable, but luckily, it dissipates within a minute.",Hard to Know if it Works,3

4778,Cute Chihuahua,These little chews are in a 30 count package and each chew is individually sealed. According to the package they are supposed to remain refrigerated. They contain Glucosamine and Chondroitin which I use myself for healthy joints and it has really helped me over the last several months. So in theory they should help a dog maintain and repair their joints as well. I can&#8217;t really comment on whether or not they have helped my Chihuahua because it&#8217;s not like she can talk to me and tell me yes my joints feel much better. They also contain MSM which I am unfamiliar with. These little chews are sometimes a little difficult to remove from the packaging and they can also be difficult to cut in half because the knife wants to slide around when you try to slice it. For my size dog you are supposed to feed one chew daily for four to six weeks and then switch to  a chew daily. It might be practical for smaller dogs but these would be really expensive to give daily to a very large dog. Dogs over 100 lbs are supposed to get six chews daily which would mean that this box would only last 6 days.The first time I gave these to my small Chihuahua I tried to play it off as a snack. She got all excited and took one sniff and stepped back. I put it on the floor and she inspected it and walked away. She has always been picky and this was not at all a snack to her.

The fleecey material springs back quickly and easily, and is light enough to flick around like a bug. Best of all: even when our cat catches it, the material slides out of her paws without much trouble, so we can keep playing (and it also means she won't be able to rip the string off the stick too easily).

4805,Peter Suslock,"""Having kept and raised Fancy Goldfish for 35+ years - Hikari has been a product I've depended on and used in the past without problems. However the formulas have changed - and not for the better.This forumula is touted as their most advanced yet, but I was concerned about the high percentage of nutrition free filler - and worse that the formula included MSG (monosodium glutamate) A soy based product known to cause migraines and a myriad of other problems in humans and animals alike.MSG is a flavor enhancer.What it does is basically fool the brain into perceiving that certain foods taste better than they actually would without the addition of MSG. In fact abundant research concludes it makes otherwise unpalatable food highly palatable.There are plenty of examples of restaurants, human foods, pet foods and countless products that boldly exclaim - No MSG!I had written to Hikari - three times asking why MSG was included in this particular formula, I've never received a response.I've been researching commercial dog food for many years, and have been making my own for equally as long. With 90% of commercial dog food, being little more than garbage, not to mention a health hazard - I've learned to assess the labels, do research and draw conclusions.As most of you know when reading any pet food list of ingredients, the first three are the most critical. I recently did a comparison between the Hikari and Omega one.Here's the ingredient list for Hikari:Fish Meal, Wheat Germ Meal, Wheat Flour, Brewer's Dried Yeast, Starch, Dried Bakery Product, Soy Bean Meal, Gluten Meal, Fish Oil, Spirulina, Vegetable Oil, Astaxanthin, Dried Seaweed Meal, Dried A. niger Fermentation Extract, Monosodium Glutamate, Dl-methionine, Garlic, Dried B. subtilis Fermentation Product, Rice Bran, Choline Chloride, Vitamin E Supplement, L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (Stabilized Vitamin C), Inositol, Calcium Pantothenate, Riboflavin, Vitamin A Oil, Thiamine Mononitrate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Niacin, Menadione Sodium Bisulfite Complex (Source of Vitamin K), Folic Acid, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Biotin, Disodium Phosphate, Ferrous Sulfate, Magnesium Sulfate, Zinc Sulfate, Manganese Sulfate, Cobalt Sulfate, Copper Sulfate, and Calcium Iodate.Here's the ingredient list for Omega One :Whole Salmon, Cod, Halibut, Wheat Flour, Wheat Gluten, Whole Kelp, Spirulina, Soy Flour, Astaxanthin, L-Ascorbyl-2-Phosphate (Source of Vitamin C), Natural and Artificial Colors, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Riboflavin, Niacin, Pantothenic Acid, Folic Acid, Biotin, Inositol, Tocopherol (Preservative), Ethoxyquin (Preservative).KEY POINTS* Hiraki doesn't identify which fish the meal is made from. Worse it's following ingredients are filler not protein.This means they change sources frequently and may be using diseased, rancid fish. Be very wary regardless of any pet food that uses vague terms like \""animal digest\"" \""ocean fish\"" or \""Meat\"" if it's not specific - it's a problem*Omega One identifies the fish they use and the first three ingredients are made from whole fish - a major sign of quality in any pet food.* There's very little \""filler\"" in Omega One in comparison to the Hikari formula. Another sign of good nutrition and quality.COST* The Hikari retails for $17.99 for 7 ounces* The Omega One retails for $5.99 for 6 ounces - a dramatically better formula and much less expensiveAs a side note, no commercial food for goldfish can replace a varied diet including fresh veggies, fruits such as bits of orange, quality gel foods, bits of defrosted raw shrimp and so on.What is more, I suggest that until Hikari changes this formula those using it should stop immediatley to avoid any potential hazard to your fish.In the mean time look to brands like Spectrum, Aqueon and Omega One - at least until Hikari revamps this forumla.""",Once A Great Food - Now One of The Worst.,1
4806,Julie F,"This helped a lot - I recently adopted an older dog who is not happy with being crated at night and barked for about an hour after going into the crate.  My attempts at draping a sheet or blanket over the crate resulted in her finding ways to pull the cover through the crate, tearing up the cover and bending the crate at the same time.  This crate cover fits very securely so she cannot pull the cover through the crate wires.  One warning, I purchased this one specifically since it claimed it had 2 door access and I was primarily using the side door to get her in and out.  The 2 doors on this cover are the front and the top of the crate, so I had to start using a different exit/entrance.  While this hasn't completely eliminated the barking, I think it has helped substantially and has also given her a nice, quiet, protected place to go for naps and such during the day.",Good crate cover,4

Capstar works for 24 hours, so you still need to be sure to regularly treat your animal for fleas with a preventative medicine that lasts for a month.

Alpo snacks command her attention and obedience, especially when (legally) off-leash near a busy street. The snaps themselves do another thing as promised. They actually can be snapped into smaller and smaller size pieces to vary the rewards without saturating her with calories.  She doesn't seem to know the or appreciate the size difference, only whether or not she is getting a treat.  The ASPCA, three years ago, gave us some Zuke's tiny peanut butter treats and she also likes these, however, I have treats in the pockets of various pants and jackets and sweaters alongside the poop bags so I will never go out unprepared. The moist Zukes soon become very hard and I will not be bothered with baggies.  The price at Amazon is 60% of the supermarket and the Prime home delivery is a delight.

But we've also learned to live with pet hair on the doormats, under the beds, and wherever else our guys decide to settle.The small Bissell was an eye opener.  It's light weight  and would be perfect for someone who has limited upper body strength.  And it's much more powerful than I expected.  For example, one of the major eye sores in our home is the door mat.  It collects pet hair and yard debris and is difficult to clean with the big vacuum.  (The suction on the larger vac pulls up the rug and we're trying to hold it down with a foot and vacuum and not all that much pet hair comes up when we try.)  The Bissell worked like a charm.  It pulled up the well entrenched fur and left the mat on the floor.  Win-win.It's also easy to maneuver and manages to fit under the beds and coffee tables.  It does not go under lower items such as the sofa and arm chairs.I like the freedom of movement that a cordless vacuum brings, but in the past I've had problems with efficiency.  But no more.The hand vacuum section is easy to remove and use; it's good for spills and furniture, but it lacks the pet hair nozzle that does such a great job on carpet.I absolutely loathe cleaning out the dirt container on any vacuum.  And this is no exception.And there's no avoiding the usual problems that come with a rechargeable battery; know before you buy that it will have to be charged.  I can't imagine having a rechargeable as my only vacuum, but it does make a really good additional vacuum.Make no mistake, this is a hand vacuum on a stick, but the pet hair brush takes it to a new dimension.Five Stars from Fred, Peachcat, and Shorty; they can go on shedding and sleeping where they don't belong.",Lives up to its promises and more....,5

4943,warchildnyc,"I was pretty disappointed with this product.  Probably the lowest quality product I have bought for any of my 7 tanks.  Although I did get it to work, kind of.The clips that hold it in place are metal, and moving them around can scratch the plastic frame of the aquarium. They also interfere with my glass canopy, preventing it from shutting tightly, and leaving a gap that will cause more evaporation of my tank water. Using multiple suction cups on the sides would be a way better design than employing these metal clips.Also, on the sides, the divider is just supposed to be jammed in with no suction cups or any way of ensuring a tight seal on either side.  I secured mine as best I could with a pile of gravel on either side holding it in place, but I expect to lose some of my tiny black convict cichlid fry to big fish on the other side when they inevitably find gaps.  I already had one small tiger barb wiggle through from the other side, and he faced an immediate beating from the  protective father of the convict fry.  Also, my banded leporinus jumped over the top, so you have to make sure divider is positioned high enough that it is above the water, or alternatively, that the canopy touches it when closed.  Doable if you have a deep substrate layer in your 55 gallon, as there is just enough divider material to eliminate the risk of fish jumping over or sneaking under.Anyway, if you want a divider for breeding purposes, this isn't a great one.  If you just want to separate one nasty, big fish from the rest of the fish in your tank, it may work ok.  Still, I could envision a big fish eventually knocking it loose if they get emboldened to keep ramming into it, as the material is so flimsy.","Flimsy, cheap plastic design, not easy to fit tightly to sides of aquarium, metal clips not well designed...",2

4949,MAP,"""Two dachshunds - one LOVES squeakers, one likes everything. It is HILARIOUS watching them drag the Gator around which is as long as they are! It took them a few tries to figure out how to jump up on the couch and carry Gator along with them - but they figured it out. They will play tug together with it. They grab it and shake it which is something they've not done with any of their other toys.SQUEAKERS - These squeakers are heavier duty than the usual stuffed toy squeakers we usually have. So far they have not punctured any of the squeakers. They have \""mangled\"" 2-3 of them although they still squeak - it's just more challenging to make them squeak. So far only one squeaker has been torn out of the body and destroyed.STUFFING - Ok, so the head did not stay stuffed very long..... I think that the mission here was to get to the rattle in the head - it intrigued them. They got the rattle out and destroyed it and the head is unstuffed - but so are all of the other previously stuffed toys.....FELT EMBELLISHMENTS - The yellow & white felt embellishments - teeth, toenails, back ridges - are all gone and were the first thing destroyed on Gator. But it gave one of the doxies so much pleasure picking them off! The eyes are ebroidered on so they are still on the head.DYE - We have not had any of the dye issues that someone else reported over a year ago.DURABILITY - The stuffed gator is a stuffed toy - it is only going to last as long as any other stuffed toy that your dog plays with. The squeakers however are a better quality and are more durable -- they are holding up pretty good all things considered. With only one squeaker torn out so far I think that this toy is going to be with us longer than most and will need to be replaced with the same or similar.We've been playing with gator for about 4 weeks and it is one of the \""top toys\"" at our house. You don't know until you try - and I'm so glad that we tried this one - it's a success!UPDATE 3/28/13 - - Sad Gator! He is now decapitated, has no stuffing, and all of the squeekers have been removed and destroyed. It was fun while it lasted!

The difference between how the cat's litter area smelled was night and day. The bags that come with the Litter Genie hold enough fecal matter that you can go quite some time before switching one out. They trap the smell wonderfully and the cats is using her litter box regularly instead of trying to sneak her dookie in with the rabbits. My wife loves the thing.I will say that the cost of the refill catridges is insane. A refill pack costs almost as much as the Litter Genie itself. It's like computer ink cartridges that cost as much as a printer. It's a bit of a scam in that regards, but since I'm reviewing the core product and not the refills, I won't knock off a star or two.
